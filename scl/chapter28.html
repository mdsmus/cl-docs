<h1>Chapter 28 - Practical Techniques for Programming</h1> 

<P>In this chapter, we'll learn some brief yet useful guidelines for
Lisp style, followed by practical advice on tradeoffs among
debugging, performance, and readability.</P>

<h2>Elements of Lisp style</h2>

<p>The art of Lisp style is simpler and more fruitful than in most other
languages.  Lisp's simple, consistent syntax eliminates the need for the
rules of style that plague more complicated languages.  And the direct,
standardized availability of complex functionality within Lisp helps to
drive down the size of programs, thereby providing improved readability
through brevity.  (In my experience, a Lisp program may range in size
from 5 percent to 20 percent of an equivalent C++ program.)

<p>Furthermore, the universal availability of Lisp-aware program editing
tools -- such as Emacs or its equivalent built into many Lisp IDEs --
means that you can let the computer handle the details of indentation 
that are so important to the ability of a person to comprehend the
structure of a Lisp program.  I've said this before, but it bears 
repeating: you should <em>not</em> be programming in Lisp without the
aid of a Lisp-aware editor.

<p>So, if we don't have to worry about conventions for spelling,
capitalization, indentation, and other such mundane details, then
what remains for us to discuss as elements of Lisp style? How about
things that are truly important? Lisp programming style is about the
choice of proper abstractions, and about communicating not just with
the compiler, but with other people who will eventually read your
program. (For that matter, good style will help you read your own
program some months or years in the future.)

<h2>Property lists are handy for small (very small) ad-hoc databases</h2>

<p>A long, long time ago the capabilities of a typical Lisp
implementation were very much less than what you'll find in any
Common Lisp system today. After all, Lisp has been around for over
forty years since John McCarthy first invented the notations (see <a
href="chapter34.html">Chapter 34</a>). Strangely, when Lisp is
taught at all in computer science curricula, it is taught using a
circa-1965 view of the state of Lisp implementations: interpreted
execution, limited data structures, and no real application beyond
the manipulation of symbols.

<p>Unfortunately, authors and publishers of Lisp textbooks did
little to help correct these misperceptions, ignoring Common Lisp
(and indeed, many of its recent forebears) in highly-recommened
Lisp textbooks published as recently as 1989.

<p>In the bad old days -- when Lisp didn't have arrays, vectors, hash 
tables, structures, or CLOS -- programmers learned to rely heavily on
property lists as an important mechanism for structuring data.  You'll
still find -- in bookstores and on the shelves of college libraries --
Lisp and AI books that recommend the use of property lists as the 
underlying basis for looking up values identified by a symbolic key.

<p>A property list is a list of alternating keys and values.  For example:
the list <code>(SEX MALE PARENTS (BOB JANE) OCCUPATION MUSICIAN)</code> 
establishes these relations:

<pre>
relation   value
---------- ----------
sex        male
parents    (bob jane)
occupation musician
</pre> 

When you attach these relations to a symbol, say <code>JAMES</code>,
then you have a way to get information related to the symbol
<code>JAMES</code>, namely the properties having the names
<code>SEX</code>, <code>PARENTS</code>, and <code>OCCUPATION</code>.

<p>In Common Lisp you can retrieve a symbol's property using
<code>(GET</code> <i>symbol</i> <i>property-name</i><code>)</code>,
and set a property using <code>(SETF (GET</code> <i>symbol</i>
<code>property-name</code><code>)</code>
<i>property-value</i><code>)</code>. 

<p>While property lists were useful substitutes for more capable
data structures in ancient Lisp implementations, they find few uses
in modern Lisp programs. One problem is efficiency. Every time you
ask Lisp to retrieve a property value, it must locate the symbol's
property list and then search the list for a matching key. If you
have five or six properties on a symbol, the search may or may not
be faster than using a hash table; the exact crossover point will
depend upon your particular Lisp implementation. The other problem
is that properties are shared among all parts of your program. It's
not too difficult to imagine two programmers using a property named
<code>COLOR</code> in two different ways in two parts of the same
program. Imagine their surprise when they discover the conflict...

<p>At any rate, you should become familiar with all of the
capabilities of Common Lisp, and learn to recognize that information
about older Lisp implementation which still haunts us through the
mists of history.

<h2>Declarations help the compiler, sometimes</h2>

<p>Common Lisp defines the following declarations:

<dl>
<dt>special
<dd>declares a variable to have dynamic (not lexical) scope
<dt>optimize
<dd>instructs the compiler how to weight the relative importance of
 <ul>
  <li>speed
  <li>safety
  <li>space
  <li>debug
  <li>compilation-speed
 </ul> 
<dt>dynamic-extent
<dd>declares that the programmer expects the lifetime of a function
    or variable to end when control leaves the enclosing form
<dt>type
<dd>declares that a variable will always have values of a given type
<dt>ftype
<dd>declares that a function should expect arguments of specified
    types, and that the function will return values or given types
<dt>ignore
<dd>declares that a variable is not referenced
<dt>ignorable
<dd>declares that a variable may not be referenced
<dt>inline
<dd>declares that the programmer would like a function to
    be compiled as inline code
<dt>notinline
<dd>declares that the programmer does not want a function to
    be compiled as inline code
</dl> 

<p>Of these, only the first and last <em>must</em> be implemented.
The rest are advisory; depending upon the implementation, the
compiler may or may not honor the given advice. If you've programmed
in other languages, you may find it strange that most of Lisp's
declarations are advisory rather than mandatory. So let's dig a bit
deeper and see what this really means to you.

<p>Lisp by default must have the <em>capability</em> to determine
the type of every variable at runtime. This is not to say that a
sufficiently smart compiler can't infer at compile time that a
variable will always be of a particular type and generate code that
does not need to check types at run time. However, an actual
"sufficiently smart compiler" remains an elusive creature, much like
the Yeti, Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster.

<p>Declarations allow the programmer to pass metainformation to the
compiler. This is not part of the program, but rather information
<em>about</em> the program. Declarations can help the compiler to
generate better code by providing information about the programmer's
<em>intent</em>. 

<p>For example, if you declare that a variable will always be a
<code>FIXNUM</code> (an integer value that fits in a single machine
word) then the compiler can emit code to load that variable directly
into a register in preparation for the next operation. If you
declare the result of the operation to also be a
<code>FIXNUM</code>, then the compiler can generate code to perform
the operation and store the result using simple machine instructions
without first checking the <code>actual</code> type of the value.
Given such declarations, a good Lisp compiler can generate code
comparable to a low-level language in which operations and types in
the language map directly onto the underlying machine.

<p>But there's a risk. If you declare certain types, and the
compiler emits code that optimizes the program according to your
declarations, and the program then <em>contradicts</em> those
declarations by providing a value of a different type at runtime,
then bad things will happen. Tell the compiler to expect two numbers
to add, then pass it a number and a symbol, and all bets are off.

<p>Fortunately, the declarations that guide the compiler are
themselves moderated by the <code>OPTIMIZE</code> declaration. The
<code>OPTIMIZE</code> declaration lets you instruct the compiler
about the relative importance of certain properties of the program.
You can specify the relative importance of the <code>SPEED</code>,
<code>SPACE</code>, and <code>SIZE</code> of the generated code. You
can specify whether you'd like to allow the compiler to spend extra
time doing a better job, or to emphasize
<code>COMPILATION-SPEED</code>. You can specify the importance of
being able to <code>DEBUG</code> your program, which may cause the
compiler to produce code that is simpler or interacts well with the
debugger.

<blockquote>
Values range from 0 to 3 for the <code>OPTIMIZE</code> declarations,
with 0 meaning "totally unimportant" and 3 meaning "most important".
The default value is 1, meaning "of normal importance".
Bear in mind that for something to be relatively more important, 
something else must be less important; it won't give the compiler
any useful guidance to specify values of 3 for all of the 
<code>OPTIMIZE</code> declarations.
</blockquote> 

<p>Of all the <code>OPTIMIZE</code> declarations, the most important is
<code>SAFETY</code>, since this affects the amount of trust the
compiler is willing to extend to your type declarations. A high
value of <code>SAFETY</code> generally compels the compiler to check
the type of every value that it can't absolutely determine at
compile time. Lower <code>SAFETY</code> values put increasing weight
upon your abilities as a programmer to guarantee that type
declarations are correct, array bounds are always in range, etc.

<p>The exact effect of declarations (with the exception of
<code>SPECIAL</code> and <code>NOTINLINE</code>) varies among Lisp
implementations; consult your reference manual for details.

<h2>DEFVAR versus DEFPARAMETER</h2>

<p>Although not required by the Common Lisp standard, almost all
implementations require that you load code from a file. (The one
exception that I know of is the Venue Medley environment, which
normally saves the entire Lisp world when you end a session. Medley
also keeps track of new definitions created in the listener and
allows you to save just those definitions to a file.) 

<p>In a file-based Lisp environment, you'll normally add definitions
to a file of source code. One reason for so doing is to periodically
save your work; unless you're debugging FFI code or running buggy
Lisp code with a low optimization value for safety, your Lisp
environment will almost never crash.  However, other disasters can
happen -- another application could crash and bring down the system
in an unprotected OS such as the Mac OS or Windows, the power could
fail, or your cat could walk across the keyboard when you leave to
refill your coffee.

<p>As your program gets larger, you may find that it's useful to
reload an entire source file after making a series of changes. Most
Lisp environments also let you evaluate one definition at a time in
any open window. This is quite useful because you can edit, then
recompile, one definition at a time. But sometimes you'll forget,
and then it's easier to just reload the entire file than to spend
time figuring out which definition you might have forgotten to
recompile after last changing its definition.

<p>But you may also be in the midst of debugging your program when
you'd like to reload its source code. If your program uses any
global variables to keep track of its state, you really <em>don't</em> 
want to reinitialize these in the midst of your debugging session.
So, how do you handle this?  You could put definitions of your
program's state variables in a separate file, but that increases
your mental workload and increases debugging time by splitting clearly
interrelated parts of your program into two separate files.  (I know
that this is an accepted practice in many programming languages, but
it really does increase the amount of work you do as a programmer.
Imagine how much less pleasurable reading a novel would be if the novel
was delivered as a set of pamphlets, one per character, and you had to
follow page references to get to the next part of the dialog.)

<p>Fortunately, Lisp has grown through decades of real-world programming
experience, and has a very simple mechanism to handle whether variables
get reinitialized or not when you load a file. You use <code>DEFVAR</code> 
to declare variables with values that need to be initialized only once.
To declare a variable with an initial value that gets set every time its
defining form is evaluated, use <code>DEFPARAMETER</code>.

<p>One final note: as a matter of form, you should name global variables
with a leading and trailing asterisk, as in <code>*MY-ADDRESS*</code>.
Think of this convention as a courtesy to those who will maintain your
code at some future date.

<h2>Define constants with DEFCONSTANT</h2>

<p>You should define global constants using
<code>DEFCONSTANT</code>. From the viewpoint of reading a Lisp
program, the distinction between <code>DEFPARAMETER</code> and
<code>DEFCONSTANT</code> is that the value defined by
<code>DEFPARAMETER</code> could concievably be altered by the user
after the program is compiled, but a <code>DEFCONSTANT</code> value
will <em>never</em> change. A good Lisp compiler will take advantage
of <code>DEFCONSTANT</code> declarations to perform classical
optimizations such as constant folding or compiling immediate load
instructions.

<p>Fewer Lisp programmers follow a naming convention for constants.
The one I use puts a leading and trailing plus sign on the name of
the constant, as in <code>+RTS-OPCODE+</code>.

<h2>Know when (not) to use the compiler</h2>

<p>Most Lisp systems include both an interpreter and a compiler;
when both are available, you'll normally find that it's easier to
debug interpreted code. Consult your vendor's documentation to 
learn how to switch between the interpreter and the compiler.

<p>Of course, when performance is important, you'll want to run
your code compiled once it's debugged.  But see the earlier cautions
about running buggy code with low safety settings.

<p>When you're writing Lisp code to run on multiple platforms, it's
safest to assume that code will run interpreted unless you call
<code>COMPILE</code> or <code>COMPILE-FILE</code>. For this reason,
you should develop the practice of writing (or using) a system
definition procedure that first loads all of your Lisp source files,
then compiles them, then loads the compiled files. This is usually
overkill, but it's a very safe, conservative approach. With suitable
source code organization and proper use of <code>EVAL-WHEN</code>
you can reduce the number of source files that must first be loaded;
the main idea is to ensure that all macros are defined before
compiling code that uses the macros, but there are other possible
situations that can depend upon the current state of the Lisp world.

<h2>Speed vs. ability to debug</h2>

<p>Interpreted programs are easier to debug because it's easier for
the debugger to access the actual source code at the point of an
error. Once you've compiled your program, the debugger typically has
less source information available; you may find yourself puzzling
over a transformed version of the source code or grovelling through
assembly-language instructions to find the source of the error.
Fortunately, the need for such low-level debugging will be rare if
you follow some simple advice:

<ol>
<li>Keep high <code>SAFETY</code> optimizations on untested code.
<li>If an interpreter is available to you, use it until your code is
    working well.
<li>If you have a compile-only environment, use lower optimization
    settings for <code>SPEED</code> and higher settings for <code>DEBUG</code>.
</ol> 

<p>Once your code is running well, then you should compile it and
adjust the optimization declarations for performance. If you find
that simply compiling your program provides adequate performance,
leave it alone. If the performance of the compiled program falls far
below your expectations, first improve the algorithm; optimization
declarations typically have a fractional impact upon performance.

<a name="efficiency"></a> 
<h2>Efficiency: spotting it, testing it</h2>

<p>The first rule of efficiency in any programming language is to
start with an efficient algorithm. It's a little harder to spot
inefficiencies in a Lisp program because the underlying operations
don't usually map directly onto a hardware instruction. But with a
certain amount of knowledge and practice, you should be able to tell
why the following four programs have radically different resource
requirements.

<p>These four programs return the sum of a list of numbers, but do
it in different ways.  In each case, we test the program with the
<code>TIME</code> form, which reports run time and memory allocation.
Each program is tested twice, once with a list of ten thousand elements, 
then again with one hundred thousand.

<pre>
<i>;; Runtime increases as the square of the number of elements</i> 
? (defun sum-list-bad-1 (list)
    (let ((result 0))
      (dotimes (i (length list))
        (incf result (elt list i)))
      result))
SUM-LIST-BAD-1
? (let ((list (make-list 10000 :initial-element 1)))
    (time (sum-list-bad-1 list)))
(SUM-LIST-BAD-1 LIST) took 2,199 milliseconds (2.199 seconds) to run.
Of that, 102 milliseconds (0.102 seconds) were spent in The Cooperative Multitasking Experience.
 16 bytes of memory allocated.
10000
? (let ((list (make-list 100000 :initial-element 1)))
    (time (sum-list-bad-1 list)))
(SUM-LIST-BAD-1 LIST) took 336,650 milliseconds (336.650 seconds) to run.
Of that, 15,680 milliseconds (15.680 seconds) were spent in The Cooperative Multitasking Experience.
 2,704 bytes of memory allocated.
100000

<i>;; Recursive version works when compiler does tail-call optimization</i> 
? (defun sum-list-bad-2 (list)
    (labels ((do-sum (rest-list sum)
               (if (null rest-list)
                 sum
                 (do-sum (rest rest-list) (+ sum (first rest-list))))))
      (do-sum list 0)))
SUM-LIST-BAD-2
? (let ((list (make-list 10000 :initial-element 1)))
    (time (sum-list-bad-2 list)))
(SUM-LIST-BAD-2 LIST) took 2 milliseconds (0.002 seconds) to run.
10000
? (let ((list (make-list 100000 :initial-element 1)))
    (time (sum-list-bad-2 list)))
(SUM-LIST-BAD-2 LIST) took 21 milliseconds (0.021 seconds) to run.
100000

<i>;; The recursive version can fail w/o tail-call optimization</i> 
? (defun sum-list-bad-3 (list)
    (declare (optimize (debug 3)))  <i>; disable tail-call optimization</i> 
    (labels ((do-sum (rest-list sum)
               (if (null rest-list)
                 sum
                 (do-sum (rest rest-list) (+ sum (first rest-list))))))
      (do-sum list 0)))
SUM-LIST-BAD-3
? (let ((list (make-list 10000 :initial-element 1)))
    (time (sum-list-bad-3 list)))
&gt; Error: Stack overflow on control stack.

<i>;; The iterative version is not as elegant, but it's fast!</i> 
? (defun sum-list-good (list)
    (let ((sum 0))
      (do ((list list (rest list)))
          ((endp list) sum)
        (incf sum (first list)))))
SUM-LIST-GOOD
? (let ((list (make-list 10000 :initial-element 1)))
    (time (sum-list-good list)))
(SUM-LIST-GOOD LIST) took 1 milliseconds (0.001 seconds) to run.
10000
? (let ((list (make-list 100000 :initial-element 1)))
    (time (sum-list-good list)))
(SUM-LIST-GOOD LIST) took 10 milliseconds (0.010 seconds) to run.
100000
</pre> 

<p>The first version, <code>SUM-LIST-BAD-1</code>, harbors a hidden
inefficiency: <code>(ELT LIST I)</code> must search
<code>LIST</code> from the beginning for each value of
<code>I</code>. In other words, <code>ELT</code> must examine one
element when <code>I</code> is 1, two elements when <code>I</code>
is 2, and so on. For a list of length <i>N</i>, <code>ELT</code>
will examine almost <i>N</i>-squared elements.  Have a look at the
runtimes for 1,000 and 10,000 elements.

<p>The second version is coded using an awareness of how lists are
accessed; the helper function <code>DO-SUM</code> calls itself
recursively with the tail of the list it is given. In
<code>SUM-LIST-BAD-2</code>, the runtime increases linearly with the
length of the input list. So why is this a <b>bad</b> example?

<p><code>DO-SUM</code> calls itself as the last form it executes;
this is known as <em>tail recursion</em>. Some compilers can compile
tail recursion as a jump instruction instead of a function call;
this eliminates the growth of the control (function return) stack
that would otherwise occur in a recursive call. However, the Common
Lisp standard does not <em>require</em> that tail calls be optimized.

<p>The third version shows what can happen when the compiler does
not optimize tail recursion. The compiler in my Lisp system disables
tail recursion optimizations when the <code>DEBUG</code>
optimization is set to 3. Without tail recursion optimization,
<code>SUM-LIST-BAD-3</code> consumes a function call frame for each
recursive call, and the program fails -- exhausting stack space --
before reaching the end of the test list.

<p>The final version, <code>SUM-LIST-GOOD</code>, uses iteration
instead of recursion for its control loop, and walks down the input
list element by element. It runs slightly faster than
<code>SUM-LIST-BAD-2</code> and doesn't fail if the compiler doesn't
support tail recursion optimization.

<h2>Recognizing inefficiency, profiling; performance vs. readability</h2>

<p>Avoidance is the best defense against inefficiency. Use appropriate 
data structures and control techniques. When you're not sure, put together
a <em>small</em> test program and time it with a variety of inputs.

<p>Every Common Lisp implementation will have the <code>TIME</code> macro
that we used to show the differences in the <code>SUM-LIST-</code><i>xxx</i> 
functions. You can use this to examine and tune small portions of a program.

<p>Once you have assembled a larger program, you may need to find
the bottleneck that causes unexpectedly low performance. For this,
you'll need a profiler. A profiler watches the execution of your whole
program and generates a report to show where the program spends its time.
Some profilers also report on memory allocation. A profiler is not a
standard part of Lisp, but most vendors provide one.  Consult your
vendor's documentation.

<p>Lisp provides abstractions that help you solve problems. You'll
find that you don't have to make a tradeoff between readability and
performance; an efficient Lisp program is usually one that is
written using the most appropriate abstractions and operations to
solve a given problem.
