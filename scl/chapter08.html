<h1>Chapter 8 - Lifetime and Visibility</h1> 

<p>In this chapter we'll see how lifetime and visibility affect the
values of Lisp variables during execution. This is pretty much like
local and global variables in other languages, but Lisp's special
variables change things. This chapter also sets the stage for
understanding that lifetime and visibility aren't just for variables.

<h2>Everything in Lisp has both lifetime and visibility</h2> 

<p>Every object in Lisp has both lifetime and visibility.  We'll see
why this is important in the following sections.

<h2>Lifetime: Creation, existence, then destruction</h2> 

<p>An object's lifetime is the period between its creation and
destruction. Some objects have fleeting lifetimes, limited to the
form in which they appear. Other objects are created as soon as the
program begins running, and are not destroyed until the program
finishes. And others enter and leave existence according to still
other rules.

<h2>Visibility: To see and to be seen by</h2> 

<p>An object is either visible or not visible at a particular point
in your program. Sometimes visibility is controlled by the execution
path of the program. But for most objects in Common Lisp, visibility
is determined by the textual arrangement of your program; this is
good, because you can reason about visibility just by reading a
program, without having to first reason about the program's control
flow.

<h2>The technical names: Extent and Scope</h2> 

<p>When you read language specifications for Common Lisp, you'll 
see the technical terms extent and scope used in place of lifetime
and visibility.  I wanted to introduce these concepts first using
the non-technical terms because I believe them to be more evocative.
But you should get used to reading about extent and scope.  Remember:

<blockquote>
<b>lifetime</b> is to <b>extent</b> <br>
as<br>
<b>visibility</b> is to <b>scope</b> 
</blockquote> 

<h2>Really easy cases: top-level defining forms</h2> 

<p>Top-level defining forms are easy. The objects so defined have
<em>indefinite</em> extent and scope. This is a fancy way of saying
that objects defined by top level forms "always" exist and are
visible (or at least potentially accessible, as I'll explain
shortly) everywhere in the program.

<p>Practically, what this means is that every object defined by a
top level form exists for as long as the program runs. The object
comes into existence when the top level form is evaluated. If the
form was compiled into a file, then the object created by the form
comes into existence when the compiled file is loaded.

<p>An object having indefinite scope is visible everywhere in your
program. It doesn't matter whether the object was created in a
different source file or at a different time -- even if it was
created <em>after</em> you define a function that references the top
level object (although some Lisp compilers will issue a warning when
you do this, the code will always behave properly if you evaluate
the object's defining form before evaluating the function that
references the object).

<blockquote>
If you're familiar with the concept of lexical scope as it
applies to programming languages, you're probably confused by the
notion of indefinite scope. If I introduce an object whose name
<em>shadows</em> the name of an object in an outer scope, then that
outer object is "not visible" in the inner scope.  And you're right,
up to a point.

<p>Lisp makes a very clear and explicit distinction between an
object and its name. We say that an object is bound to a name, or
that a (named) binding is established for an object. And it is very
true that a <em>binding</em> in an inner lexical scope may shadow a
<em>binding</em> in an outer scope. However, the scope of the outer
object extends into the inner scope, even though it is inaccessible
via its shadowed binding. This is an important distinction, because
an object may have more than one binding, and the object must remain
accessible via any binding which has not been lexically shadowed.
</blockquote> 

<h2>Scope and extent of parameters and LET variables</h2> 

<p>Objects bound by function parameters and <code>LET</code> forms
have lexical scope. Their bindings are visible beginning at a
certain textual location in the defining form and continuing through
the textual end of the defining form. Any reference to a textually
identical name from outside of the defining form must refer to a
different binding. A nested defining form may declare a binding that
shadows an enclosing binding to a textually identical name.

<blockquote>
This is a slightly more rigorous restatement of concepts
introduced in <a href="chapter03-06.html">Chapter 3, Lesson 6</a>.
If you need to refresh your memory, this would be a good time to <a
href="chapter03-06.html">go back</a> and review the examples in
that short passage.
</blockquote> 

<a name="special"></a> 
<h2>Slightly trickier: special variables</h2> 

<p>Special variables (also known by the more technically correct
term <em>dynamic variables</em>) have <em>dynamic</em> scope. This
means that a binding is created for a special variable as a result
of executing some form in your program. The scope of the dynamic
binding extends into any form called (directly or indirectly) by the
form which established the dynamic binding.

<p>The extent of a special variable lasts indefinitely, until the
form that created the dynamic binding is no longer a site of active
program execution -- in other words, until the defining form (and
all of the forms called by it) finishes executing.  If the dynamic
binding is created by a top level form, the extent is the same as 
described previously for top level defining forms.

<pre>
? (defparameter *my-special-variable* 17)
*MY-SPECIAL-VARIABLE*
? (defun show-my-special ()
    (declare (special *my-special-variable*))
    (print *my-special-variable*)
    nil)
SHOW-MY-SPECIAL
? (defun do-something-else ()
    (show-my-special))
DO-SOMETHING-ELSE
? (defun dynamically-shadow-my-special ()
    (let ((*my-special-variable* 8))
      (do-something-else))
    (show-my-special))
DYNAMICALLY-SHADOW-MY-SPECIAL
? (dynamically-shadow-my-special)

8
17
NIL
</pre> 

<p>When reading the above, pay special attention to
<code>DO-SOMETHING-ELSE</code> -- this calls
<code>SHOW-MY-SPECIAL</code>. <code>SHOW-MY-SPECIAL</code> would
normally see the lexical value of <code>*MY-SPECIAL-VARIABLE*</code>
-- 17 -- except for the declaration which says that
<code>*MY-SPECIAL-VARIABLE*</code> is a special variable.

<p><code>DYNAMICALLY-SHADOW-MY-SPECIAL</code> binds
<code>*MY-SPECIAL-VARIABLE*</code> to the value 8, then calls
<code>DO-SOMETHING-ELSE</code>, which in turn calls
<code>SHOW-MY-SPECIAL</code>. At this point, the <code>LET</code>
binding of <code>*MY-SPECIAL-VARIABLE*</code> is not lexically
apparent to the code in <code>SHOW-MY-SPECIAL</code>. Yet, because
the binding is declared special at the point of reference, and
because the binding <code>LET</code> form is still active when
<code>DO-SOMETHING-ELSE</code> calls <code>SHOW-MY-SPECIAL</code>,
the <em>dynamic</em> binding of 8 (rather than the lexical binding
of 17) is printed.

<p>Later during execution, the second call to
<code>SHOW-MY-SPECIAL</code> happens outside of the <code>LET</code>
form, and the top level value of <code>*MY-SPECIAL-VARIABLE*</code>
-- 17 -- is printed.

<blockquote> Strictly speaking, the <code>(DECLARE (SPECIAL
...</code> form is not necessary in <code>SHOW-MY-SPECIAL</code> --
the <code>DEFPARAMETER</code> form has the side effect of
proclaiming its variable to be special. However, the added
declaration adds redundant documentation at the point of use of the
special variable. Furthermore, some Lisp compilers will issue a
warning (typically: "<samp>Undeclared free variable assumed
special</samp>") that is easily silenced by adding the declaration.
