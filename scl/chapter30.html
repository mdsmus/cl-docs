<h1>Chapter 30 - Helpful Hints for Debugging and Bug-Proofing</h1> 

<P>As with any programming language, error avoidance is the best
debugging strategy. Take advantage of the online documentation 
(available with most systems) and test functions, or even parts
of functions, as you write them.

<p>Still, you'll inevitably face the unexpected error, and you
should know how to use the debugger. More often than not, a quick
look at the error location as shown by the debugger will point out
an obvious problem. 

<p>Some problems, though, are not obvious; your program will run
without error, but produce incorrect results. When examination of
the code does not reveal an error, you can rely upon built in Lisp
tools to expose the details of your program's operation and find the
error during execution.

<h2>Finding the cause of an error</h2>

<p>There are two ways to notice an error. The intrusion of the Lisp
debugger is the most obvious. The debugger will appear whenever your
program causes Lisp to signal an error. This is often the result of
something obvious, like trying to perform arithmetic on
<code>NIL</code> or trying to <code>FUNCALL</code> an object that is
not a function.

<p>Your program's failure to produce expected results is also an
error, even though the debugger never appears. In this case, your
program doesn't make any mistakes in its use of Lisp, but the
successful sequence of Lisp operations doesn't do what you had
intended.  Another possibility is that your program will fail to
terminate at all.

<p>The best defense against all of these problems is to write 
short, clear function definitions and test each one as soon as
you've written it.  I find it helpful to write one or more test
cases and include them as comments (bracketed by #| and |#) in
the same file.  

<h2>Reading backtraces, compiler settings for debugging</h2>

<p>Every Lisp debugger will provide at least two important
pieces of information: an error message and a stack backtrace.

<p>The error message describes <em>how</em> the program failed.
Normally, this is a description of an error encountered while 
executing some built in Lisp function.  If your program calls
<em>ERROR</em>, the debugger will display the message you
specify.

<p>The stack backtrace describes <em>where</em> your program
failed by displaying the call stack at the point of the error.
The function which signalled the error will be at the "top" of
the stack.  Below that is the function that called the function
which signalled the error, and so on all the way to (and
sometimes beyond) the listener's read-eval-print loop.

<p>The debugger relies upon certain information provided by
the compiler or interpreter.  Although the details vary among
implementations, it's safe to say that compiler optimizations
that improve speed or reduce space tend to reduce the amount
of information available to the debugger.  You can change these
optimizations while debugging your program:

<pre>
(declaim (optimize (speed 0) (space 0) (debug 3)))
</pre> 

<p>If you execute this before compiling your program, the debugger
should be able to give you more useful information. You should
consult your vendor's documentation to learn about additional
implementation-specific controls. If your Lisp system gives you a
choice between using a compiler and using an interpreter, you'll
probably find that the interpreter causes the debugger to give you
better information.

<h2>Simple debugging tools</h2>

<p>If your program runs to completion but produces incorrect
results, or if it runs but fails to terminate, then you'll need some
additional tools. The first of these tools should be familiar to all
programmers: insert a call to the debugger or (more commonly) insert
a print statement.

<h2>BREAK, PRINT</h2>

<p><code>BREAK</code> causes your program to call the debugger.  Once
inside the debugger you can examine the call stack.  Most debuggers 
also allow you to examine values local to each active function on the
call stack; by looking at these values at a critical point during your
program's execution, you may find an important clue as to why your
program malfunctions.

<p>The debugger will allow you to continue from a break. You may
find it helpful -- if you don't yet understand the cause of a
problem -- to correct one or more wrong values before continuing; with
other <code>BREAK</code> forms inserted at key points in your program,
this strategy may lead you to a place where the error <em>is</em> 
apparent.

<p>Of course, you can always insert <code>PRINT</code> forms at key
locations in your program and examine the resulting output.  In Lisp,
this is most useful when you need to get a feel for what's happening
deep inside some function.  For example, you might have a complex
calculation to determine whether a sequence of code is executed or
not.  A <code>PRINT</code> can tell you as the program runs.

<p>Don't forget that you can use <code>FORMAT</code> to print the
values of several variables together with explanatory text.  And with
either <code>PRINT</code> or <code>FORMAT</code>, be careful that you
do not change the meaning of the code by inserting the debugging
statement.  Remember that some flow-control forms (e.g. <code>IF</code> 
and <code>UNWIND-PROTECT</code>) expect a single form at certain places.
Also beware of wrapping <code>PRINT</code> around a value-returning
form; this won't work if the value-receiving form expects multiple
values.

<h2>Power tools for tough problems</h2>

<p>Lisp provides additional debugging tools to help you observe the
dynamic behavior of your program.

<h2>TRACE, STEP, ADVISE, WATCH</h2>

<p><code>TRACE</code> allows you to observe each call and return from
a specific function, no matter where the function appears in your program.
To trace a function, invoke <code>TRACE</code> with the name of the
function.  You can do this for as many functions as needed.  You can
also pass several function names to <code>TRACE</code>.

<p>When your program runs a traced function, it will print the name of
the function on entry and exit.  Most <code>TRACE</code> implementations
will also print the function arguments on entry and returned values on
exit.

<p>To discontinue tracing of a function, pass its name to
<code>UNTRACE</code>. To discontinue tracing of <em>all</em> traced
functions, evaluate <code>(UNTRACE)</code>.

<p>See <a href="chapter16.html#trace-and-step">Chapter 16</a> for an
example of <code>TRACE</code>.

<p><code>STEP</code> allows you to interactively control evaluation of
an expression.  If you step a function invocation, you should be able
to examine each subform of the function's definition just before it
is evaluated.  <code>STEP</code> implementations vary widely, so you
should consult your vendor's documentation for further details.  In
general, the same optimizations and controls that aid the debugger will
also aid the stepper.

<p><code>STEP</code> is a very labor-intensive way to debug a program,
since you must tell its user interface to evaluate each subform.  This
is reasonable for straight-line code, but quickly becomes tedious in 
the presence of looping or recursion.

<p>Some Lisp implementations provide two additional tools,
<code>ADVISE</code> and <code>WATCH</code>, that can be of use during
debugging.  

<p><code>ADVISE</code> modifies a function without changing its
source code. <code>ADVISE</code> can usually examine the advised
function's arguments, execute its own code, execute the advised
function, examine the advised function's return values, and modify
the returned values.  For debugging purposes, <code>ADVISE</code> 
can be used to implement conditional <code>BREAK</code>s and 
<code>TRACE</code>s, or to temporarily patch incorrect behavior
in one part of a program while you're debugging another part.

<p><code>WATCH</code> lets you specify variables to be displayed
as your program executes.  This is normally available only in 
Lisp implementations that provide a windowed user interface.
Because of issues of variable scope and display update timing and
overhead, <code>WATCH</code> is of limited value.  Most Lisp 
implementations do not provide this tool.

<h2>Into the belly of the beast</h2>

<p>As you debug your program, you may need to see the internal
details of composite objects such as lists, structures, arrays,
streams and CLOS instances.  Lisp lets you do this whether the
data has been defined by your program or by the Lisp runtime
system.

<h2>INSPECT, DESCRIBE</h2>

<p><code>DESCRIBE</code> is a function that accepts any object as an
argument and prints a description of that object. The form and
content of the description may vary among Lisp implementations.
<code>DESCRIBE</code> accepts an output stream as an optional second
argument.

<p><code>INSPECT</code> is an interactive version of
<code>DESCRIBE</code>. This is most useful for examining complex
objects by "drilling down" into the implementation details of
enclosed data elements.

<h2>Continuing from an error</h2>

<p>When faced with the debugger, you will have a choice of restart
actions depending upon how the error was signalled.  <code>ERROR</code> 
requires that you abandon your program's executions.  However,
many internal Lisp functions use <code>CERROR</code>, which gives you
a chance to continue from an error.

<p>In most debuggers, you can do quite a few useful things before
continuing from an error:

<ul>
<li>alter variable values
<li>redefine the function that caused the error and run it again
<li>skip the rest of the function that caused the error and 
    specify values to be returned
<li>restart any function further down the call stack
<li>skip the rest of any function further down the call stack and
    specify values to be returned
</ul> 

<h2>Problems with unwanted definitions</h2>

<p>Unwanted definitions are not usually a problem in a Lisp program.
You can get rid of function definitions using
<code>FMAKUNBOUND</code>, variable values with
<code>MAKUNBOUND</code>, and even symbols with
<code>UNINTERN</code>. In practice, there's usually no need to use
any of these; available memory is commonly large compared to the
size of a few misdefined variables or functions, and they will be
eliminated anyway the next time you restart your Lisp image and load
your program.

<p>Method definitions are an entirely different matter.  Remember that
methods must have congruent argument lists; if you change your mind
during program development about a method's argument list -- perhaps
you thought that it needed two arguments at first but then realized
three arguments are really needed -- then you'll have to remove the
old method definition before adding the new one.  Some Lisp environments
facilitate this redefinition:

<pre>
? (defmethod baz (a b))
#&lt;STANDARD-METHOD BAZ (T T)&gt;
? (defmethod baz (a b c))
Error: Incompatible lambda list in #&lt;STANDARD-METHOD BAZ (T T T)&gt;
       for #&lt;STANDARD-GENERIC-FUNCTION BAZ #x3D2CB66&gt;.
Restart options:
  1. Remove 1 method from the generic-function and change its lambda list
  2. Top levl
  ? 
</pre> 

<p>If you simply add a method that you later decide is no longer
wanted, you'll need a way to remove the method. The least desirable
technique is to restart your Lisp system and reload your program
without the unwanted definition. Another approach, provided by some
vendors, is to interactively remove the definition using a special
editor command or a method browser. Failing all else, you can remove
the method manually using <code>REMOVE-METHOD</code>:

<pre>
(let* ((generic-function (symbol-function '<i>gf-name</i>))
       (method (find-method generic-function
                            '(<i>method-specializers</i>)
                            (list (find-class <i>parameter-class-name</i>)
                                  <i>; one per argument</i> 
                                  ...))))
  (remove-method generic-function method))
</pre> 

<p>where <i>gf-name</i> is the name of the generic function (i.e.
the name of the method), <i>method-specializers</i> is either empty
or a method combination specifier, such as <code>:BEFORE</code>,
<code>:AFTER</code>, or <code>:AROUND</code>, and
<i>parameter-class-name</i> is the name of the class on which a
particular method parameter is specialized.

<h2>Package problems; method definitions</h2>

<p>Symbol conflicts across packages can be frustrating during
development. If you have defined multiple packages for your program,
you'll need to be careful to set the proper package (using
<code>IN-PACKAGE</code>) before defining an object intended for that
package.  If you inadvertently create an object in the wrong package
and then attempt to define it in the correct package, Lisp will signal
an error if there is a "uses" relationship between the two packages.
The proper response is to first remove the erroneous definition using
<code>UNINTERN</code>.

<p>You can also get into trouble with packages by having unexported
classes defined in two packages and specializing a method based on the
wrong class.

<h2>The problem with macros</h2>

<p>Macros must always be defined before use.  This is especially 
important when you redefine a macro during development: every piece
of code that uses the redefined macro <code>must</code> be recompiled.
You can help yourself avoid macro redefinition problems by reloading
your source code after redefining any macro(s).

<h2>Runtime tests catch "can't happen cases" when they do...</h2>

<p>When I read code, finding the phrase "can't happen" in a comment
always raises a red flag. Usually, this statement is made after the
programmer has examined the code's execution environment and
intended use. Unfortunately, things change and "can't happen" cases
do happen.

<p>Lisp provides a very handy facility for checking "can't happen"
statements at runtime.  The <code>ASSERT</code> macro expects a 
form that will evaluate to true at runtime.  If the form evaluates
to <code>NIL</code> instead, <code>ASSERT</code> signals a continuable
error, transferring control to the debugger.  At the very least, this
will help you to learn which assertion was violated so you can 
correct your program.

<p><code>ASSERT</code> accepts an optional list of value places that
the user can interactively change to satisfy the assertion.

<pre>
? (defun add-2 (n)
    (assert (numberp n) (n))
    (+ 2 n))
? (add-2 3)
5
? (add-2 'foo)
Error: Failed assertion (NUMBERP N)
Restart options:
  1. Change the values of some places, then retry the assertion
  2. Top level
  ? 1
  Value for N: 4
6
</pre> 

See <a href="chapter23.html">Chapter 23</a> for additional
information about 
<a href="chapter23.html#assert"><code>ASSERT</code></a> and other error
detection and recovery techniques.

<h2>Use method dispatch rather than case dispatch</h2>

<p>When your program needs to make a decision based on the type of
an object, you have two choices. You can use <code>TYPECASE</code>
or <code>DEFMETHOD</code>. Unless you have a circumstance that
particularly warrants the use of <code>TYPECASE</code> (or its
variants <code>CTYPECASE</code> and <code>ETYPECASE</code>) -- and
especially if the set of types will change during normal program
evolution or maintenance -- you should probably construct your
program to operate on the individual types via generic functions.
This more clearly exposes the intent of the program and eliminates
the likelihood that you will forget to update a
<code>TYPECASE</code> form during maintenance.
