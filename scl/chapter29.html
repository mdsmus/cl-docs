<h1>Chapter 29 - I Thought it was Your Turn to Take Out the Garbage</h1> 

<P>Chapter objective: Describe the benefits and costs of garbage collection. 
Show how to improve program performance by reducing the amount of garbage 
it generates.</P>

<h2>What is garbage?</h2>

<p>In simplest terms, garbage is any storage that your program once
used, but uses no longer. Here's a simple example:

<pre>
(let ((x (list 1 2 3 4 5)))
  (print x))
</pre> 

<p>When you evaluate this form, the list <code>'(1 2 3 4 5 6)</code> is
first bound to <code>X</code> and then printed.  Once control leaves the
<code>LET</code> form, the list bound to <code>X</code> is no longer
accessible; its storage can be reclaimed by the garbage collector.

<blockquote> Actually, there's a minor complication that you should
know about. When you evaluate a form in the Lisp listener, the form
itself is assigned to the symbol <code>+</code>, and the value is
assigned to the symbol <code>*</code>. The previous form and value
are assigned to <code>++</code> and <code>**</code>, respectively,
and the form and value before that are assigned to <code>+++</code>
and <code>***</code>. Because these three pairs of variables give
you a way to access the forms and results, a form and its result
can't really become garbage until you've evaluated additional forms
to flush these six variables. 

<p>You won't normally have to worry about this unless you've done
something in the listener to exhaust all available memory in Lisp;
if you can evaluate a simple expression (like <code>T</code>) three
times, you'll release any storage held by <code>+</code>,
<code>*</code>, and friends.</blockquote> 

<h2>Why is garbage collection important?</h2>

<p>Lisp allocates storage as needed for your program's data. You don't
have direct control over how or when storage is allocated; the
compiler is free to do the best job it can to satisfy the meaning of
your program.

<p>Lisp does not provide a way for your program to explicitly
deallocate storage. This is an important feature, because you can
never write a program to mistakenly deallocate storage that is still
needed elsewhere in the program. This eliminates an entire class of
errors, sometimes referred to as "dead pointer bugs" in languages
that support explicit storage allocation and deallocation.

<p>On the other hand, your program may eventually run out of memory
if your program never deallocates storage. So a language (like Lisp)
that doesn't support explicit deallocation must still provide a
mechanism to automatically deallocate storage when the storage is no
longer needed. The garbage collector's job is to figure out which
storage can no longer be accessed by your program, and then recycle
those inaccessible storage blocks for later use.

<h2>How does garbage collection work?</h2>

<p>Lisp compiles your program in such a way that all of its allocated
storage can be found by following pointers from a small number of known
<em>root</em> pointers. The compiler and runtime system arrange for your
program to retain type information at runtime; this is combined with 
compile-time knowledge of storage layouts to encode knowledge of the
locations of pointers within data structures.

<p>The garbage collector follows every pointer in every reachable
data structure, starting with the root set. As it does so, it marks
the reachable data structures. Once every pointer has been followed,
and its referenced data structure marked, any block of memory that
is unmarked is unreachable by your program. The garbage collector
then reclaims these unmarked blocks for future use by the storage
allocator.

<blockquote> The actual marking algorithm used by the garbage
collector must account for cycles in the reachable data structures,
and must perform in limited space and time; these details complicate
the implementation of a garbage collector. Also, most collectors
will relocate the marked data (and adjust references accordingly).
<a href="chapter33.html#jones96">[Jones96]</a> provides an excellent
survey and analysis of various garbage collection techniques.
</blockquote> 

<h2>What effect does garbage have on my program?</h2>

<p>Garbage causes your program to run slower.  The more garbage
your program creates, the more time the garbage collector will need
to spend recycling the garbage.  Modern garbage collectors are very
efficient; it's unlikely that you'll see a noticeable pause in your
program's execution as the garbage collector runs.  However, the 
cumulative effect of many small pauses will cause a detectable 
degradation in overall performance.

<p>The good news is that garbage collection ensures that your
program will <em>never</em> suffer from memory leaks or dead
pointers. 

<p>Also, because many garbage collector implementations rearrange
storage as your program runs, heap fragmentation is minimized; thus,
a large Lisp program's performance will not degrade over time like a
C or C++ program that performs comparable storage allocation
(typically 25 to 50 percent degradation for a C or C++ program,
depending upon heap size, malloc/free implementation, and
allocation/deallocation patterns).

<blockquote> You should note that explicit storage allocation and
deallocation has overheads which are not strictly predictable. In
typical malloc and free implementations, block allocation involves a
search and deallocation involves extra work to coalesce free blocks;
both of these activities are of effectively indeterminate duration,
affected by the size and fragmentation of the heap. </blockquote> 

<h2>How can I reduce garbage collection pauses in my program?</h2>

<p>You can reduce garbage collection overhead by reducing garbage
generation. Use appropriate data structures; list manipulation is
the most common cause of garbage creation in poorly-written Lisp
programs. Pay attention to whether an operation returns a fresh copy
or a (possibly modified) existing copy of data.

<p>If you have a profiler available in your Lisp system, use it to 
find your program's hot spots for storage allocation.

<p>Use destructive operations carefully; they can reduce garbage
generation, but will cause subtle bugs if the destructively-modified
data is shared by another part of your program.
