<h1>Chapter 19 - Streams</h1> 

<p>All of the I/O functions in Lisp accept a stream argument. In
some cases (e.g. <code>READ</code> and <code>PRINT</code>) the
stream argument is optional; by default, input comes from the
<code>*STANDARD-INPUT*</code> stream (normally connected to the
keyboard) and output goes to the <code>*STANDARD-OUTPUT*</code>
stream (normally connected to the display). You can redirect I/O by
either providing optional stream arguments to <code>READ</code> and
<code>PRINT</code> (as well as other I/O functions), or by binding
<code>*STANDARD-INPUT*</code> and <code>*STANDARD-OUTPUT*</code> to
different streams. (We'll see both of these approaches used in the
following examples.)

<h2>Streams provide a pipe to supply or accept data</h2>

<p>Throughout the preceding chapters of this book, streams have
been involved whenever we've seen an example that does input or
output -- and <em>all</em> of the examples do I/O, if you count our
interactions with the listener. A Lisp stream can provide (source)
or consume (sink) a sequence of bytes or characters. (Remember the
Lisp definition of byte: a byte can contain any number of bits.)

<p>Some I/O functions accept <code>T</code> or <code>NIL</code> as a
stream designator. <code>T</code> is a synonym for
<code>*TERMINAL-IO*</code>, a bidirectional (input <em>and</em>
output) stream which conventionally reads from
<code>*STANDARD-INPUT*</code> and writes to
<code>*STANDARD-OUTPUT*</code>. <code>NIL</code> is a synonym for
<code>*STANDARD-INPUT*</code> when used in a context which expects
an input stream, or for <code>*STANDARD-OUTPUT*</code> when used in
a context which expects an output stream.

<blockquote>
<code>FORMAT</code> (which we've already seen in several examples, and
will examine in depth in <a href="chapter24.html">Chapter 24</a>) expects
as its first argument a stream, a <code>T</code>, a <code>NIL</code>, or
a string with a fill pointer.  In this case, however, the <code>NIL</code> 
designator causes <code>FORMAT</code> to return a string, rather than write
to <code>*STANDARD-OUTPUT*</code> as is the case for other I/O functions.
</blockquote> 

<p>The power of streams comes from the ability to associate a stream
with a file, a device (such as keyboard, display, or network), or a
memory buffer. Program I/O can be directed at will by simply
creating the appropriate type of stream for your program to use. The
I/O implementation is abstracted away by the stream so your program
won't have to be concerned with low-level details.

<p>Lisp also provides a number of special-purpose streams which
serve to combine or manipulate other streams in novel ways. A
<code>TWO-WAY-STREAM</code> combines a separate input stream and
output stream into an I/O stream. A <code>BROADCAST-STREAM</code>
sends output to zero or more output streams; think of this as a
bit-bucket when used with zero streams, and a broadcaster when used
with multiple streams. A <code>CONCATENATED-STREAM</code> accepts
input requests on behalf of zero or more input streams; when one
stream's input is exhausted, the <code>CONCATENATED-STREAM</code>
begins reading from its next input stream. An
<code>ECHO-STREAM</code> is like a <code>TWO-WAY-STREAM</code>, with
the added feature that anything your program reads from the
<code>TWO-WAY-STREAM</code>'s input stream automatically gets echoed
to the corresponding output stream. Finally, a
<code>SYNONYM-STREAM</code> is an alias for another stream; the
alias can be changed at runtime without creating a new
<code>SYNONYM-STREAM</code>.

<p>Quite a few I/O functions operate directly on streams:

<p>

<dl>
<dt><code>READ-BYTE</code> <i>stream &amp;optional eof-error-p eof-value</i> 
    and <code>READ-CHAR</code> <i>&amp;optional stream eof-error-p eof-value recursive-p</i>  
<dd>Reads a byte or a character from an input stream.

<dt><code>WRITE-BYTE</code> <i>byte stream</i> 
    and <code>WRITE-CHAR</code> <i>char &amp;optional stream</i> 
<dd>Writes a byte or a character to an output stream.

<dt><code>READ-LINE</code> <i>&amp;optional stream eof-error-p eof-value recursive-p</i>
    and <code>WRITE-LINE</code> <i>string &amp;optional stream &amp;key start end</i> 
<dd>Read or write a line of text, terminated by a newline.  (The newline
is consumed and discarded on input, and added to output.) The 
<code>:START</code> and <code>:END</code> keyword arguments let you 
limit the portion of the string written by <code>WRITE-LINE</code>.

<dt><code>WRITE-STRING</code> <i>string &amp;optional stream &amp;key start end</i> 
<dd>Like <code>WRITE-LINE</code>, but does not append a newline to output.

<dt><code>PEEK-CHAR</code> <i>&amp;optional peek-type stream eof-error-p eof-value recursive-p</i>
<dd>Reads a character from an input stream without consuming the character.
(The character remains available for the next input operation.) Optional
argument <i>peek-type</i> alters <code>PEEK-CHAR</code>'s behavior to first
skip whitespace (<i>peek-type</i> <code>T</code>) or to first skip forward 
to some specified character (<i>peek-type</i> a character).

<dt><code>UNREAD-CHAR</code> <i>character &amp;optional stream</i> 
<dd>Pushes a character (which must be the character most recently read)
back onto the front of an input stream, where it remains until read again.

<dt><code>LISTEN</code> <i>&amp;optional stream</i> 
<dd>Returns true if data is available (e.g. a yet-to-be-read keystroke or
unconsumed file data) on an input stream.

<dt><code>READ-CHAR-NO-HANG</code> <i>&amp;optional stream eof-error-p eof-value recursive-p</i>
<dd>If a character is available on the input stream, return the character.
Otherwise, return <code>NIL</code>.

<dt><code>TERPRI</code> <i>&amp;optional stream</i> 
    and <code>FRESH-LINE</code> <i>&amp;optional stream</i> 
<dd><code>TERPRI</code> unconditionally writes a newline to an output
stream. <code>FRESH-LINE</code> writes a newline unless it can determine
that the output stream is already at the beginning of a new line; 
<code>FRESH-LINE</code> returns <code>T</code> if it actually wrote a 
newline, and <code>NIL</code> otherwise.

<dt><code>CLEAR-INPUT</code> <i>&amp;optional stream</i>
<dd>Flushes unread data from an input stream, if it makes sense to do so.

<dt><code>FINISH-OUTPUT</code> <i>&amp;optional stream</i>, 
    <code>FORCE-OUTPUT</code> <i>&amp;optional stream</i>, and 
    <code>CLEAR-OUTPUT</code> <i>&amp;optional stream</i>
<dd>These functions flush output buffers if it makes sense to do so.
<code>FINISH-OUTPUT</code> tries to make sure that buffered output
reaches its destination, then returns.  
<code>FORCE-OUTPUT</code> attempts to initiate output from the buffer,
but does not wait for completion like <code>FINISH-OUTPUT</code>.
<code>CLEAR-OUTPUT</code> attempts
to discard buffered data and abort any output still in progress.
</dl> 

<p>In the read functions listed above, optional arguments 
<code>EOF-ERROR-P</code> and <code>EOF-VALUE</code> specify what happens
when your program makes an attempt to read from an exhausted stream.
If <code>EOF-ERROR-P</code> is true (the default), then Lisp will signal
an error upon an attempt to read an exhausted stream. If 
<code>EOF-ERROR-P</code> is <code>NIL</code>, then Lisp returns
<code>EOF-VALUE</code> (default <code>NIL</code>) instead of signalling
an error.

<p>Optional argument <code>RECURSIVE-P</code> is reserved for use by
functions called by the Lisp reader.


<h2>Creating streams on files</h2>

<p>The <code>OPEN</code> function creates a
<code>FILE-STREAM</code>. Keyword arguments determine attributes of
the stream (<code>:DIRECTION</code>, <code>:ELEMENT-TYPE</code>, and
<code>:EXTERNAL-FORMAT</code>) and how to handle exceptional
conditions (<code>:IF-EXISTS</code> and
<code>:IF-DOES-NOT-EXIST</code>). If <code>OPEN</code> is successful
it returns a stream, otherwise it returns <code>NIL</code> or
signals an error.

<pre>
Keyword      Value     Stream Direction
----------   -------   -----------------------------
:DIRECTION   :INPUT    input (default)
:DIRECTION   :OUTPUT   output
:DIRECTION   :IO       input & output
:DIRECTION   :PROBE    none, returns a closed stream

Keyword      Value                Action if File Exists
----------   ------------------   ---------------------------------------
:IF-EXISTS   NIL                  return NIL
:IF-EXISTS   :ERROR               signal an error
:IF-EXISTS   :NEW-VERSION         next version (or error)
:IF-EXISTS   :RENAME              rename existing, create new
:IF-EXISTS   :SUPERSEDE           replace file upon CLOSE
:IF-EXISTS   :RENAME-AND-DELETE   rename and delete existing, create new
:IF-EXISTS   :OVERWRITE           reuse existing file (position at start)
:IF-EXISTS   :APPEND              reuse existing file (position at end)

Keyword              Value     Action if File Does Not Exist
------------------   -------   -----------------------------
:IF-DOES-NOT-EXIST   NIL       return NIL
:IF-DOES-NOT-EXIST   :ERROR    signal an error
:IF-DOES-NOT-EXIST   :CREATE   create the file

Keyword         Value               Element Type
-------------   --------------      ------------------------
:ELEMENT-TYPE   :DEFAULT            character (default)
:ELEMENT-TYPE   'CHARACTER          character
:ELEMENT-TYPE   'SIGNED-BYTE        signed byte
:ELEMENT-TYPE   'UNSIGNED-BYTE      unsigned byte
:ELEMENT-TYPE   <i>character subtype</i>   character subtype
:ELEMENT-TYPE   <i>integer subtype</i>     integer subtype
:ELEMENT-TYPE   <i>other</i>               implementation-dependent

Keyword            Value      File Format
----------------   --------   ------------------------
:EXTERNAL-FORMAT   :DEFAULT   default (default)
:EXTERNAL-FORMAT   <i>other</i>      implementation-dependent
</pre> 

<p>Once you've opened a stream, you can use it with appropriate 
input or output functions, or with queries that return attributes
of either the stream or the file.  The following queries can be
applied to all kinds of streams.  All of these accept a stream argument:

<pre>
Function               Returns
--------------------   -----------------------------------------------------
INPUT-STREAM-P         true if stream can provide input
OUTPUT-STREAM-P        true if stream can accept output
OPEN-STREAM-P          true if stream is open
STREAM-ELEMENT-TYPE    the type specifier for stream elements
INTERACTIVE-STREAM-P   true if stream is interactive (e.g. keyboard/display)
</pre> 

<p>These queries can be applied to file streams.  These also accept a stream
argument:

<pre>
Function                 Returns
--------------------     -----------------------------------------------------
STREAM-EXTERNAL-FORMAT   implementation-dependent
FILE-POSITION            current file offset for read or write, or NIL
FILE-LENGTH              length of stream, or NIL
</pre> 

<p><code>FILE-POSITION</code> returns a byte offset within the stream.
This is an exact count for streams of integer subtypes (see below for
further description of binary I/O). For streams of character subtypes,
the position is guaranteed only to increase during reading or writing;
this allows for variations in text record formats and line terminators.

<p><code>FILE-POSITION</code> can also be called with a second argument to
change the file offset for the next read or write.  When used for this
purpose, <code>FILE-POSITION</code> returns true when it succeeds.

<p>You should always close a stream when you're done using it
(except for the interactive streams provided for you use by Lisp,
such as <code>*STANDARD-INPUT*</code>,
<code>*STANDARD-OUTPUT*</code>, and <code>*TERMINAL-IO*</code>). The
"open, process, close" pattern is very common, so Lisp provides macros
to make the pattern both easy to code and error-free.

<p><code>WITH-OPEN-FILE</code> is tailored for file streams. Its arguments
are a variable to be bound to the stream, a pathname, and (optionally)
keyword arguments suitable for <code>OPEN</code>. The stream is always
closed when control leaves the <code>WITH-OPEN-FILE</code> form.

<pre>
(with-open-file (stream "my-file.dat" :direction :input)
  ... do something using stream ...)
</pre> 

<p><code>WITH-OPEN-STREAM</code> expects a variable name and a form to
be evaluated; the form should produce a stream value or <code>NIL</code>.
This macro is commonly used with constructors for specialty streams,
such as <code>MAKE-BROADCAST-STREAM</code>, <code>MAKE-ECHO-STREAM</code>, 
<code>MAKE-TWO-WAY-STREAM</code>, <code>MAKE-CONCATENATED-STREAM</code>, 
and <code>MAKE-SYNONYM-STREAM</code>.

<h2>Creating streams on strings</h2>

<p>The data read or written by a stream doesn't have to be associated
with a device -- the data can just as well be in memory. String streams
let you read and write at memory speeds, but they can't provide either
file or interactive capabilities.  Lisp provides constructors
(<code>MAKE-STRING-INPUT-STREAM</code> and 
<code>MAKE-STRING-OUTPUT-STREAM</code>), plus macros to support the
"open, process, close" pattern.

<pre>
? (with-input-from-string (stream "This is my input via stream.")
    (read stream))
THIS
? (with-output-to-string (stream)
    (princ "I'm writing to memory!" stream))
"I'm writing to memory!"
</pre> 

<p>These macros accept keyword and optional arguments.
<code>WITH-INPUT-FROM-STRING</code> allows <code>:BEGIN</code> and
<code>:END</code> keyword arguments to establish bounds on the
portion of the string read via the stream. A <code>:INDEX</code> keyword
argument lets you name a variable to receive the offset of the next
string element to be read -- this is set only upon leaving the 
<code>WITH-INPUT-FROM-STRING</code> form.

<p><code>WITH-OUTPUT-TO-STRING</code> allows an optional form, which is
evaluated to produce the output string; if this form is missing or
<code>NIL</code>, the macro creates a string for you using the
<code>:ELEMENT-TYPE</code> keyword argument.

<h2>Binary I/O</h2>

<p>Lisp supports binary I/O via streams whose element types are
finite (i.e. bounded) subtypes of <code>INTEGER</code>. Some
examples of appropriate types are:

<ul>
<li>Implementation-dependent
<ul>
 <li><code>SIGNED-BYTE</code> 
 <li><code>UNSIGNED-BYTE</code> 
</ul> 
<li>Range of values
<ul>
 <li><code>(INTEGER 0 31)</code> 
 <li><code>(INTEGER -16 15)</code> 
</ul> 
<li>Specific number of bits
<ul>
 <li><code>(SIGNED-BYTE 8)</code> 
 <li><code>(UNSIGNED-BYTE 6)</code> 
 <li><code>BIT</code> 
</ul> 
</ul> 

<p>ANSI Common Lisp implementations should support any of these
types for binary I/O.  However, the implementation is not required to 
directly map the specified <code>:ELEMENT-TYPE</code> onto the 
underlying file system; an implementation is permitted to alter the
external format so long as data read from a binary file is the same
as that written using the same <code>:ELEMENT-TYPE</code>.
