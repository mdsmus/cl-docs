<h1>Chapter 5 - Introducing Iteration</h1> 

<p>Lisp has several ways to do iteration. In this section we'll look at
the most common looping constructs. Later, in <a href="chapter12.html">Chapter 12</a>, we'll look at mapping, then we'll take a brief look at <i>series</i> in 
<a href="chapter32.html">Chapter 32</a>; both of these are closely related to
iteration.<p>

<h2>Simple LOOP loops forever...</h2>

<p>The simplest loop in Lisp is just a <code>LOOP</code> form
wrapped around whatever you want to repeat. Before you try this next
bit of code, know how to interrupt execution of your Lisp system;
normally this is Command-period on a Macintosh or Control-Break on a
PC.

<pre>
? (loop
    (print "Look, I'm looping!"))
"Look, I'm looping!" 
"Look, I'm looping!" 
"Look, I'm looping!" 
"Look, I'm looping!" 
"Look, I'm looping!" 
"Look, I'm looping!" 
"Look, I'm looping!" 
"Look, I'm looping!" 
<i>... and so on, until you interrupt execution...</i> 
Aborted
? 
</pre> 

<p>This kind of endless loop has legitimate applications. You're already
familiar with one: <code>(LOOP (PRINT (EVAL (READ))))</code>, Lisp's
read-eval-print loop.<p>

<blockquote>
Actually, your Lisp system does some extra things in its read-eval-print loop: 
<ul>
<li>it catches all errors to prevent you from inadvertently breaking out of the 
loop
<li>it provides a controlled way to exit the loop
<li>it keeps track of the most recently entered expressions, results, and
printed output
</ul> 
</blockquote> 

<h2>But there's a way out!</h2>

<p>Most of the time you write a <code>LOOP</code> form, you'd like to have
a way out. Fortunately, a <code>RETURN</code> form anywhere inside will cause control to leave the <code>LOOP</code>; any value you specify becomes the
value of the <code>LOOP</code> form:<p>

<pre>
? (loop
    (print "Here I am.")
    (return 17)
    (print "I never got here."))
"Here I am."
17
</pre> 

<code>RETURN</code> is normally used in a conditional form, like this:

<pre>
? (let ((n 0))
    (loop
      (when (&gt; n 10) (return))
      (print n) (prin1 (* n n))
      (incf n)))
0 0
1 1
2 4
3 9
4 16
5 25
6 36
7 49
8 64
9 81
10 100
NIL
?
</pre> 

<p>This example could be done better using a <code>DOTIMES</code>
form, see below. But the combination of <code>LOOP</code> and
<code>RETURN</code> offers the flexibility to return from the middle
of a loop, or even from several places within the loop if need
be.<p>

<h2>Use DOTIMES for a counted loop</h2>

<p>To simply loop for some fixed number of iterations, the
<code>DOTIMES</code> form is your best choice. The previous example
simplifies to:<p>

<pre>
? (dotimes (n 11)
    (print n) (prin1 (* n n)))
0 0
1 1
2 4
3 9
4 16
5 25
6 36
7 49
8 64
9 81
10 100
NIL
?
</pre> 

<code>DOTIMES</code> always returns NIL (or the result of evaluating
its optional third argument).</p>


<h2>Use DOLIST to process elements of a list</h2>

<p>Another common use for iteration is to process each element of a list.
<code>DOLIST</code> supports this:<p>

<pre>
? (dolist (item '(1 2 4 5 9 17 25))
    (format t "~&amp;~D is~:[n't~;~] a perfect square.~%" item (integerp (sqrt item))))
1 is a perfect square.
2 isn't a perfect square.
4 is a perfect square.
5 isn't a perfect square.
9 is a perfect square.
17 isn't a perfect square.
25 is a perfect square.
NIL
</pre> 

<blockquote> <p>In this example, we've done some fancy things with
<code>FORMAT</code>. If you want to learn more about what
<code>FORMAT</code> can do, you should look ahead now to <a
href="chapter24.html">Chapter 24</a>. </blockquote> 

<p>The preceding code used a list of numbers, but Lisp allows a
list to contain any kind of object:<p>

<pre>
? (dolist (item `(1 foo "Hello" 79.3 2/3 ,#'abs))
    (format t "~&amp;~S is a ~A~%" item (type-of item)))
1 is a FIXNUM
FOO is a SYMBOL
"Hello" is a (SIMPLE-BASE-STRING 5)
79.3 is a DOUBLE-FLOAT
2/3 is a RATIO
#&lt;Compiled-function ABS #x1E9CC3E&gt; is a FUNCTION
NIL
? 
</pre> 

<blockquote>
Note how we used the backquote and comma to build the list in this example.
Do you understand why we did this?  All of the list elements up through
the ratio <code>2/3</code> are self-evaluating; we could have put them in
a quoted list as we did in the previous example. But <code>#'abs</code> is
equivalent to <code>(function abs)</code> which, when quoted, is just a list
of two symbols. To get the function itself into the quoted list, we had to
force evaluation of the <code>#'abs</code> form, thus the comma inside the
backquoted list.
</blockquote> 

<p>Like <code>DOTIMES</code>, <code>DOLIST</code> always returns
<code>NIL</code> (or the result of its optional third argument).


<h2>DO is tricky, but powerful</h2>

<p>The <code>DO</code> form lets you iterate over multiple variables at the
same time, using arbitrary forms to step each variable to its next value.
Here's an example which both iterates over the elements of a list and runs
a counter at the same time:<p>

<pre>
? (do ((which 1 (1+ which))
       (list '(foo bar baz qux) (rest list)))
      ((null list) 'done)
    (format t "~&amp;Item ~D is ~S.~%" which (first list)))
Item 1 is FOO.
Item 2 is BAR.
Item 3 is BAZ.
Item 4 is QUX.
DONE
? 
</pre> 

<p>To understand this better, let's look at the general syntax of
<code>DO</code>, and relate its parts to the example:

<pre>
(do ((<i>var1 init1 step1</i>)
     (<i>var2 init2 step2</i>)
     <i>...</i>)
    (<i>end-test result</i>)
  <i>statement1
  ...</i>)

<i>var1</i>       = which
<i>init1</i>      = 1
<i>step1</i>      = (1+ which)
<i>var2</i>       = list
<i>init2</i>      = '(foo bar baz qux)
<i>step2</i>      = (rest list)
<i>end-test</i>   = (null list)
<i>result</i>     = 'done
<i>statement1</i> = (format t "~&amp;Item ~D is ~S.~%" which (first list))
</pre>
