<h1>Chapter 9 - Introducing Error Handling and Non-Local Exits</h1> 

<p>In this chapter we'll see some of the specialized control flow
forms provided by Common Lisp.

<h2>UNWIND-PROTECT: When it absolutely, positively has to run</h2>

<p>One of the challenges of writing robust programs is to make sure
that important parts of your code always run, even in the presence of
errors. Usually, this is most important when you're allocating,
using and releasing resources such as files and memory, like this:

<pre>
<i>; Setup</i> 
Allocate some resources
Open some files
<i>; Process</i> 
Process using files and storage (may fail)
<i>; Cleanup</i> 
Close the files
Release the resources
</pre> 

<p>If the processing step might fail (or be interrupted by the user)
you should make sure that every possible exit path still goes
through the cleanup section to close the files and release the
storage. Better still, your program should be prepared to handle
errors that occur during the setup phase as you allocate storage and
open files, since any of these operations might also fail; any
partially completed setup should still be undone in the cleanup
section.

<p>Lisp's <code>UNWIND-PROTECT</code> form makes this especially
easy to do.

<pre>
(let (resource stream)
  (unwind-protect
    (progn
      (setq resource (allocate-resource)
            stream (open-file))
      (process stream resource))
    (when stream (close stream))
    (when resource (deallocate resource))))
</pre> 

<p>Here's what happens. The <code>LET</code> binds
<code>RESOURCE</code> and <code>STREAM</code> to <code>NIL</code> --
we'll use the <code>NIL</code> value to mean that there has been no
resource allocated or file opened. The first form in the
<code>UNWIND-PROTECT</code> is a "protected" form; if control leaves
the protected form via <em>any</em> means, then the rest of the
forms -- the "cleanup" forms -- are guaranteed to be executed.

<p>In our example, the protected form is a <code>PROGN</code> that
calls <code>ALLOCATE-RESOURCE</code> and <code>OPEN-FILE</code> to
set our local variables, then <code>PROCESS</code> uses these
resources. <code>SETQ</code> assigns values sequentially to our
local variables: <code>(ALLOCATE-RESOURCE)</code> must succeed
before a value can be assigned to <code>RESOURCE</code>, then
<code>OPEN-FILE</code> must succeed before its value can be assigned
to <code>STREAM</code>. A failure (i.e. an interrupt or error) at
any point in this sequence will transfer control out of the protected
form.

<p>If the initializations succeed and <code>PROCESS</code> returns
normally, control continues into the cleanup forms. 

<p>If anything causes the protected form to exit -- for example, an
error or an interrupt from the keyboard -- control is transferred
immediately to the first cleanup form. The cleanup forms are guarded
by <code>WHEN</code> clauses so we won't try to close the stream or
deallocate the resource if an error caused them to never be created
in the first place.

<h2>Gracious exits with BLOCK and RETURN-FROM</h2>

<p>The <code>BLOCK</code> and <code>RETURN-FROM</code> forms give
you a structured lexical exit from any nested computation. The
<code>BLOCK</code> form has a name followed a body composed of zero
or more forms. The <code>RETURN-FROM</code> form expects a block
name and an optional (the default is <code>NIL</code>) return value.

<pre>
? (defun block-demo (flag)
    (print 'before-outer)
    (block outer
      (print 'before-inner)
      (print (block inner
               (if flag
                 (return-from outer 7)
                 (return-from inner 3))
               (print 'never-print-this)))
      (print 'after-inner)
      t))
BLOCK-DEMO
? (block-demo t)

BEFORE-OUTER
BEFORE-INNER
7
? (block-demo nil)

BEFORE-OUTER
BEFORE-INNER
3
AFTER-INNER
T
</pre> 

<p>When we call <code>BLOCK-DEMO</code> with <code>T</code>, the
<code>IF</code> statement's consequent -- <code> (return-from outer
7)</code> -- immediately returns the value 7 from the <code>(BLOCK
OUTER ...</code> form. Calling <code>BLOCK-DEMO</code> with
<code>NIL</code> executes the alternate branch of the
<code>IF</code> -- <code>(return-from inner 3)</code> -- passing the
value 3 to the <code>PRINT</code> form wrapped around the
<code>(BLOCK INNER ...</code> form.

<p>Block names have lexical scope: <code>RETURN-FROM</code>
transfers control to the <code>innermost</code> <code>BLOCK</code>
with a matching name.

<p>Some forms implicitly create a block around their body forms.
When a name is associated with the form, such as with
<code>DEFUN</code>, the block takes the same name.

<pre>
? (defun block-demo-2 (flag)
    (when flag
      (return-from block-demo-2 nil))
    t)
BLOCK-DEMO-2
? (block-demo-2 t)
NIL
? (block-demo-2 nil)
T
</pre> 

<p>Other forms, such as the simple <code>LOOP</code> and
<code>DOTIMES</code>, establish a block named <code>NIL</code>
around their body forms. You can return from a <code>NIL</code>
block using <code>(RETURN-FROM NIL ...)</code>, or just
<code>(RETURN ...)</code>.

<pre>
? (let ((i 0))
    (loop
      (when (&gt; i 5)
        (return))
      (print i)
      (incf i)))

0
1
2
3
4
5
NIL
? (dotimes (i 10)
    (when (&gt; i 3)
      (return t))
    (print i))

0
1
2
3
T
</pre> 

<h2>Escape from anywhere (but not at any time) with CATCH and THROW</h2>

<p>So <code>BLOCK</code> and <code>RETURN-FROM</code> are handy for
tranferring control out of nested forms, but they're only useful
when the exit points (i.e. block names) are lexically visible.  But
what do you do if you want to break out of a chain of function calls?

<pre>
<i>; WARNING! This won't work!</i> 
(defun bad-fn-a ()
  (bad-fn-b))

(defun bad-fn-b ()
  (bad-fn-c))

(defun bad-fn-c ()
  (return-from bad-fn-a))  <i>; There is no block BAD-FN-A visible here!</i> 
</pre> 

<p>Enter <code>CATCH</code> and <code>THROW</code>, which let you
establish control transfers using dynamic scope. Recall that dynamic
scope follows the chain of active forms, rather than the textual
enclosure of one form within another of lexical scope.

<pre>
? (defun fn-a ()
    (catch 'fn-a
      (print 'before-fn-b-call)
      (fn-b)
      (print 'after-fn-b-call)))
FN-A
? (defun fn-b ()
    (print 'before-fn-c-call)
    (fn-c)
    (print 'after-fn-c-call))
FN-B
?(defun fn-c ()
   (print 'before-throw)
   (throw 'fn-a 'done)
   (print 'after-throw))
FN-C
? (fn-a)

BEFORE-FN-B-CALL 
BEFORE-FN-C-CALL 
BEFORE-THROW 
DONE
</pre> 

<h2>Making sure files only stay open as long as needed</h2>

<p>Opening a file just long enough to process its data is a very
common operation. We saw above that <code>UNWIND-PROTECT</code> can
be used to ensure that the file gets properly closed. As you might
expect, such a common operation has its own form in Lisp.

<pre>
(with-open-file (stream "file.ext" :direction :input)
  (do-something-with-stream stream))
</pre> 

<p><code>WITH-OPEN-FILE</code> wraps an <code>OPEN</code> and
<code>CLOSE</code> form around the code you provide, and makes sure
that the <code>CLOSE</code> gets called at the right time. All of
the options available to <code>OPEN</code> may be used in
<code>WITH-OPEN-FILE</code> -- I've shown the options you'd use to
open a file for input.
