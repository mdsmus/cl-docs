<title>Successful Lisp - Chapter 2</title>

<body bgcolor="white" text="black"><h1>Chapter 2 - Is this Book for Me?</h1> 

<P>Depending upon your background, interest, and experience, your need for 
the information offered in this book is best met by following the material 
in a certain way.  I think that most readers will place themselves in one 
of the following categories: <a href="#professional">professional 
programmer</a>, <a href="#student">student</a>, <a 
href="#hobbyist">hobbyist</a>, <a href="#former">former Lisp user</a>, or 
<a href="#curious">merely curious</a>.  No matter which category you fit, 
I've described what I think you can gain by reading this book.  As you read 
through this book, you may decide that you no longer fit your original 
category.  This is fine -- there are no strong dependencies between 
chapters.  If you get stuck on a particular concept, the detailed <a 
href="contents.html">Table of Contents</a> will help you locate the 
information you need.</P>

<h2><a name="professional">The Professional Programmer</a></h2> 

<P>This book tells you what you need to know about Lisp in order to write 
good programs, and to read Lisp code in journals, magazines, or other 
people's programs.  Beyond that, I will introduce you to some important 
concepts that you may not have encountered in your use of other languages, 
or you may find that the Lisp approach to a familiar concept gives you a 
new perspective on an old idea.  Even if you never have occasion to use 
Lisp on the job, the concepts you'll learn in this book may give you a 
fresh insight to help solve a tough problem in your favorite language.  
You'll probably want to skim up through Chapter 6 to make sure you've 
covered the basics.  Then slow down and take a closer look at what 
interests you in <a href="chapter07.html">Chapter 7</a> through <a 
href="chapter09.html">Chapter 9</a>, <a href="chapter11.html">Chapter 
11</a> through <a href="chapter15.html">Chapter 15</a>, <a 
href="chapter17.html">Chapter 17</a> through <a 
href="chapter21.html">Chapter 21</a>, <a href="chapter23.html">Chapter 
23</a>, and <a href="chapter24.html">Chapter 24</a>; these chapters cover 
concepts that are either unique to, or best expressed in, the Lisp 
language.</P>

<P>Beyond all else, I hope to impress upon you the dynamic nature of Lisp 
program development.  Lisp usually is a pleasant surprise to someone 
accustomed (or resigned) to the usual edit, compile, link, and debug 
cycle.  The biggest change is compilation of functions rather than files.  
You can change and recompile just one function at a time, even from within 
the debugger.  This is really handy if you've spent hours of testing to 
find a problem that can be easily fixed with one small change to your 
program.  This is just one example of how the Lisp programming environment 
supports your programming efforts.  You'll find additional examples 
throughout this book.  <a href="chapter10.html">Chapter 10</a>, <a 
href="chapter16.html">Chapter 16</a>, <a href="chapter22.html">Chapter 
22</a>, and <a href="chapter26.html">Chapter 26</a> through <a 
href="chapter28.html">Chapter 28</a> will give you an appreciation of how 
Lisp supports dynamic program development.</P>

<h2><a name="student">The Student</a></h2> 

<P>If you've learned Lisp in a typical classroom setting, you may have come 
to believe that the language is nothing but lists and recursion.  This 
book will show you that Lisp has a rich assortment of data types and 
control structures.  Lists and recursion are only the tip of the iceberg.  
<a href="chapter03.html">Chapter 3</a> through <a 
href="chapter24.html">Chapter 24</a> should fill in the details on the 
rest of Lisp.  Skim the remaining chapters so you know where to look when 
you have access to a commercial Lisp development environment, for when you 
begin your first Lisp project outside of an academic setting.</P>

<P>Depending upon whether you're currently taking a Lisp course, or have already 
finished a course and want to learn what the instructor didn't have time 
for, this book will help your studies by teaching you an appreciation for 
the language and the skills you'll need for its most effective use.  <a 
href="appendix-a.html">Appendix A</a> lists sources of Lisp development 
environments.  You can use the freeware versions while you're still a 
poor, starving student, and refer to the list again when you're gainfully 
employed and want to either recommend a commercial implementation of Lisp 
to your employer or buy one for personal use.</P>

<h2><a name="hobbyist">The Hobbyist</a></h2> 

<P>To me, a hobbyist is someone who pursues programming for the challenge, 
for the learning experience, or as a pastime.  The hobbyist is largely 
self taught.  If you fit that mold, I'll warn you now that Lisp can be 
very challenging, and can teach you a lot about programming.</P>

<P>You can go quite a long way toward learning Lisp with one of the freeware 
systems available for Macintosh and DOS computers.  But if you have 
aspirations to turn your hobby into a money making venture, you need to 
ask yourself whether Lisp is appropriate for your anticipated product or 
service.  If you think in terms of databases or scripts or multimedia, 
you'll probably be happier with a tool that directly addresses your area 
of interest.  If you have dreams of writing the next great videogame, 
you've probably already discovered that you need a language that lets you 
program "close to the machine" -- If so, Lisp will disappoint you.  But if 
you want to give your game characters complex interactions, or even the 
appearance of intelligent behavior, Lisp is a wonderful vehicle in which 
to design and test prototypes of these behaviors.</P>

<P>No matter what your interest in programming as a hobby, this book will 
give you the understanding you need to explore Lisp without getting bogged 
down in the parentheses.  Read through all of the chapters, spending more 
time on those which interest you the most.  If you have access to a Lisp 
development system, spend time on <a href="chapter10.html">Chapter 10</a>, 
<a href="chapter16.html">Chapter 16</a>, <a href="chapter22.html">Chapter 
22</a>, and <a href="chapter28.html">Chapter 28</a> through <a 
href="chapter30.html">Chapter 30</a>; these chapters will give you the 
background you need in order to find your way when you get lost -- you'll 
find this more helpful than trying to develop an encyclopedic knowledge of 
the language.</P>

<h2><a name="former">The Former Lisp Acquaintance</a></h2> 

<P>If you've had a prior experience with Lisp, perhaps in a college or 
university programming class, this book will update your knowledge.  This 
book will teach you things that a one semester class could never 
cover due to time constraints.  You'll also see how commercial Lisp 
development systems provide tools and features missing from the freeware 
Lisp system that your educational institution probably used.</P>

<P>If you've worked on (or have attempted) a Lisp project before, you may not 
have had the benefit of a mentor to show you how to use Lisp effectively.  
This book will introduce you to the skills that you need to become a 
successful Lisp programmer.  It is important that you understand what the 
language does; this book, like others before it, covers that ground.  But 
this book goes beyond other Lisp programming books to tell you why Lisp 
works as it does, the best way to do things in Lisp, and (perhaps 
most importantly) how to approach the Lisp development 
<em>environment</em> to accomplish your goals in the most effective way.</P>

<P>I suggest that you use this book as a reference.  The detailed <a 
href="contents.html">Table of Contents</a> will help you find subject 
areas that appeal to your interests or needs.</P>

<h2><a name="curious">The Curious</a></h2> 

<P>If you have no immediate intentions of writing a Lisp program (perhaps 
you're a student of programming languages), this book is still a good 
choice.  You can learn a lot about Lisp, its development environment, and 
its use by reading through the chapters in order and working out an 
occasional bit of code on paper, to check your understanding.  I've tried 
hard to introduce the fundamentals of Lisp in a way that doesn't belabor 
the details of internal representation.</P>
