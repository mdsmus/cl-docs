<h1>Chapter 10 - How to Find Your Way Around, Part 1</h1> 

<p>In this chapter, you'll learn how to find your way around Common Lisp
without resorting so often to the manuals.  (You <em>do</em> read the
fine manuals, don't you?)

<p>Oh, there's one thing you should keep in mind while you're reading
this chapter: all of these tools work equally well for the built-in
functionality of your Lisp system and for all of the Lisp programs 
that you write.

<h2>APROPOS: I don't remember the name, but I recognize the face</h2>

<p>Common Lisp defines 978 symbols.  Whatever implementation you use
probably defines hundreds of additional symbols for language extensions,
additional libraries, a graphical user interface, etc.  Are you going
to remember the names of all these symbols?  Not likely...

<p>What you <em>can</em> do is to remember part of the name. This is
pretty easy, because the language and library designers have a
limited memory (just like you and me) and they tend to name related
objects with similar names. So, most of the mapping functions (see
<a href="chapter12.html">Chapter 12</a>) will have <code>MAP</code>
in their names, the GUI library will probably have
<code>WINDOW</code> in the names of all the functions, macros, and
variables having something to do with windows, and so on.

<p>Once you have a good guess at a part of a name, you can find
<em>all</em> of the matching names by using a very handy tool named
<code>APROPOS</code>.

<pre>
? (apropos "MAP" :cl)
MAP, Def: FUNCTION
MAP-INTO, Def: FUNCTION
MAPC, Def: FUNCTION
MAPCAN, Def: FUNCTION
MAPCAR, Def: FUNCTION
MAPCON, Def: FUNCTION
MAPHASH, Def: FUNCTION
MAPL, Def: FUNCTION
MAPLIST, Def: FUNCTION
</pre> 

<p><code>APROPOS</code> expects a string or a symbol -- this
provides the fragment of the name that you'd like to find. An
optional second argument designates a package; use it if you'd like
to limit your search to the symbols in a particular package. The
package designator can be a string or symbol matching the name or
nickname of a package (see <a href="chapter03-10.html">Chapter 3,
Lesson 10</a>), or it can be the package object itself. If you omit
the package designator, then <code>APROPOS</code> will search for
symbols in <em>all</em> packages.

<p>Your Lisp implementation may produce output that looks somewhat
different from that shown here. Generally, you'll see the symbol
names listed with a very brief description of the global object
named by the symbol.

<p>Here's an example of the output from <code>APROPOS</code> on my
Lisp system when I search without a package designator:

<pre>
? (apropos "SEQUENCE")
       TOOLS::BROWSER-SEQUENCE-TABLE
         CCL::CHECK-SEQUENCE-BOUNDS, Def: FUNCTION
     ITERATE::CHECK-SEQUENCE-KEYWORDS, Def: FUNCTION
       TOOLS::CLASS-BROWSER-SEQUENCE-TABLE
     ITERATE::CLAUSE-FOR-IN-SEQUENCE-0, Def: FUNCTION
     ITERATE::CLAUSE-FOR-INDEX-OF-SEQUENCE-0, Def: FUNCTION
         CCL::CONSED-SEQUENCE
<i>; many lines omitted</i> 
              STREAM-READ-SEQUENCE, Def: STANDARD-GENERIC-FUNCTION
              STREAM-WRITE-SEQUENCE, Def: STANDARD-GENERIC-FUNCTION
   DEFSYSTEM::SYSTEMS-SEQUENCE-DIALOG-ITEM
              TAB-SEQUENCE-ITEM
              TABLE-SEQUENCE, Def: STANDARD-GENERIC-FUNCTION
             :TABLE-SEQUENCE,  Value: :TABLE-SEQUENCE
  SETF::|CCL::TABLE-SEQUENCE|, Def: STANDARD-GENERIC-FUNCTION
              WRITE-SEQUENCE, Def: FUNCTION
</pre> 

<p>Notice that most of the symbols are prefixed with a package name,
since they are not imported into the current (COMMON-LISP-USER)
package. Again, your Lisp implementation may produce somewhat
different results, but it should show you a list of symbols with
package prefixes, plus whatever other information the designers of
your implementation thought would be helpful yet concise.

<p>In these examples, I've used uppercase strings as arguments to
<code>APROPOS</code>. Some implementations perform a case-sensitive
match, while others ignore case. Symbol names are case sensitive in
Lisp, but the Lisp reader translates symbols to uppercase by
default. So if you specify an uppercase name to <code>APROPOS</code>
you'll find most -- perhaps all -- of the matching names; you'll
miss only those that were intentionally interned using lower case
letters. And if your <code>APROPOS</code> ignores case, you'll get
all of the matches, regardless of case.

<p>You could also supply a symbol to <code>APROPOS</code>. The only
disadvantage of this is that these partial symbols pollute the
namespace of the current package. The storage requirement is
trivial, but you'll have to be aware that <code>APROPOS</code> may
find these partial symbols in future matches, and you'll have to
ignore these to find the symbols you'd really like to see.

<h2>DESCRIBE: Tell me more about yourself</h2>

<p>Once you know the name of a symbol, you can get additional information
by using the <code>DESCRIBE</code> function.  As with <code>APROPOS</code>,
the output of <code>DESCRIBE</code> varies among Lisp implementations.
Here's an example generated using my Lisp system:

<pre>
<i>; Describe a symbol</i> 
? (describe 'length)
Symbol: LENGTH
Function
EXTERNAL in package: #&lt;Package "COMMON-LISP"&gt;
Print name: "LENGTH"
Value: #&lt;Unbound&gt;
Function: #&lt;Compiled-function LENGTH #x34C39B6&gt;
Arglist: (SEQUENCE)
Plist: (:ANSI-CL-URL "fun_length.html")
<i>; Describe a string</i> 
? (describe "LENGTH")
"LENGTH"
Type: (SIMPLE-BASE-STRING 6)
Class: #&lt;BUILT-IN-CLASS SIMPLE-BASE-STRING&gt;
Length: 6
0: #\L
1: #\E
2: #\N
3: #\G
4: #\T
5: #\H
<i>; Describe a function</i> 
? (describe #'length)
#&lt;Compiled-function LENGTH #x34C39B6&gt;
Name: LENGTH
Arglist (declaration): (SEQUENCE)
</pre> 

<p>This example used three different argument types: a symbol, a
string, and a function. These are all correct, but you get what you
ask for. These all have their uses, but you will generally want to
supply a symbol argument to <code>DESCRIBE</code>, because it tends
to produce the most information.

<h2>INSPECT: Open wide and say "Ah..."</h2>

<p><code>INSPECT</code> is like <code>DESCRIBE</code>, but instead
of printing the information it presents the information in some kind
of interactive display; typically either a command loop in the
current listener or a new window with its own user interface.  You
should experiment with <code>INSPECT</code> on your own Lisp system
to learn how it behaves.

<p><code>INSPECT</code> is very handy for exploring complex nested
data structures, since you can "drill down" to just the information
that interests you at the moment. Most <code>INSPECT</code>s offer
specialized viewers for certain types of data, such as functions and
CLOS objects. Many implementations of <code>INSPECT</code> also
allow you to edit the data being inspected.

<h2>DOCUMENTATION: I know I wrote that down somewhere</h2>

<p>Sometimes, you need to know more about a variable than you
can discover with <code>INSPECT</code>. And for functions, you
really need the programmer's description (unless you're willing to
read assembly language code, see <a href="chapter16.html">Chapter
16</a> if you have these urges). The <code>DOCUMENTATION</code>
function gives you access to the programmer's innermost thoughts (or
at least what she was willing to write in a documentation string).

<p>The <code>DOCUMENTATION</code> function expects two arguments.
The first is an object for which you wish to retrieve documentation,
or a symbol naming that object. The second is a symbol designating
the kind of documentation (there are several) you wish to retrieve.

<blockquote> The interface described above is the one required by
the ANSI Common Lisp specification. Some implementations still
support an interface which predates the ANSI specification -- these
expect a symbol for both arguments. We'll use that convention in our
examples, since it works in both ANSI and pre-ANSI implementations.
</blockquote> 

<p>Several Lisp constructs let you provide an optional documentation
string. The following table shows the second
<code>DOCUMENTATION</code> argument (first line of each pair)
together with the Lisp constructs for which documentation strings
are retrieved. 

<dl>
<dt><code>'variable</code> 
<dd><code>defvar</code>, <code>defparameter</code>, <code>defconstant</code> 
<dt><code>'function</code> 
<dd><code>defun</code>, <code>defmacro</code>, special forms
<dt><code>'structure</code> 
<dd><code>defstruct</code> 
<dt><code>'type</code> 
<dd><code>deftype</code> 
<dt><code>'setf</code> 
<dd><code>defsetf</code> 
</dl> 

<p>The list above works in both ANSI and pre-ANSI Lisp
implementations. The following list shows the documentation types
which have been added for ANSI implementations.

<dl>
<dt><code>'compiler-macro</code> 
<dd><code>define-compiler-macro</code> 
<dt><code>'method-combination</code> 
<dd><code>define-method-combination</code> 
<dt><code>t</code> 
<dd>Documentation returned depends upon type of first argument.
</dl> 

<p>Here are some examples:

<pre>
? (documentation 'length 'function)
"returns the number of elements in sequence."
? (defun a-function-with-docstring ()
    "This function always returns T."
    t)
A-FUNCTION-WITH-DOCSTRING
? (documentation 'a-function-with-docstring 'function)
"This function always returns T."
</pre> 

<p>If you specify a symbol for which there is no documentation, or a
documentation type which does not select documentation defined for
the symbol, then <code>DOCUMENTATION</code> will return
<code>NIL</code>.

<p>A Lisp implementation is permitted to discard documentation
strings. If documentation strings from your own program are not
accessible via the <code>DOCUMENTATION</code> function, consult your
implementation's manual to find out whether there's a way to retain
documentation strings (there usually is). If documentation strings
are missing from Common Lisp functions or from vendor supplied
libraries, consult your vendor.
