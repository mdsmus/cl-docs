<h1>Chapter 3 - Essential Lisp in Twelve Lessons</h1> 

<h2><A NAME="lesson-12">Lesson 12 - Essential Reader Macros</A></h2> 

<h3>The reader turns characters into data</h3> 

<P>We saw in <A HREF="chapter03-11.html">Lesson 11</A> that the Lisp 
reader gathers constituent characters into symbols and numbers, and that macro 
characters control the reader to handle lists, strings, quoted forms, and 
comments.  In all of these cases, the reader turns characters into data.  
(For reasons that will become clear shortly, a comment is just "no data.")</P>

<h3>Standard reader macros handle built-in data types</h3> 

<P>So far, we've seen just the <EM>standard syntax</EM> for Lisp.  This is 
implemented by the reader, and controlled by the <EM>readtable</EM>.  The 
reader works by processing characters according to information stored in 
the readtable.</P>

<h3>User programs can define reader macros</h3> 

<P>Lisp exposes the readtable through the <CODE>*readtable*</CODE> 
variable, and provides several functions to manipulate entries in 
readtables.  You can use these to alter the behavior of the Lisp reader.  
In the following example, we change the syntax so we can write quoted (i.e.  
unevaluated) lists using <CODE>[</CODE> and <CODE>]</CODE>.</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80><I>;This is wrong:</I><br><IMG SRC="gifs/circle-dot.gif" ALT="?"

ALIGN="BOTTOM"> (set-macro-character #\[ #'open-bracket-macro-character)<br><IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> T<br><br><IMG SRC="gifs/circle-dot.gif" ALT="?" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> (set-macro-character #\] (get-macro-character #\)))<br><IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> T<br><br><I>;Now try it:</I><br><IMG SRC="gifs/circle-dot.gif" ALT="?" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> [1 2 3 4 5 6]<br><IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> (1 2 3 4 5 6)</PRE>

<P>First we tried to evaluate <CODE>(1 2 3 4 5 6)</CODE> -- this is wrong 
because <CODE>1</CODE> is not a function.  What we really meant to do was 
to quote the list.  But if we're going to do this often, we'd like a more 
convenient syntax.  In particular we'd like <CODE>[...]</CODE> to behave 
like <CODE>'(...)</CODE>.</P>

<P>To make this work, we have to define a specialized list reader macro 
function that doesn't evaluate its arguments.  We'll arrange for the 
function to be called when the reader encounters a <CODE>[</CODE> 
character; the function will return the list when it encounters a <CODE>]</CODE> 
character.  Every reader macro function gets called with two arguments: 
the input stream and the character that caused the macro to be invoked.</P>
  
<P>Our reader macro is very simple because Lisp has a function designed to 
read delimited lists.  <CODE>READ-DELIMITED-LIST</CODE> expects one 
argument -- the character which will terminate the list being read.  The 
other two arguments are optional -- the input stream and a flag which is 
normally set to <CODE>T</CODE> when used in reader macro functions.
<CODE>READ-DELIMITED-LIST</CODE> reads objects from the input stream until 
it encounters the terminating character, then returns all of the objects 
in a list.  By itself, this does everything we need <EM>except</EM> for 
suppressing evaluation.</P>

<P><CODE>QUOTE</CODE> (or <CODE>'</CODE>) suppresses evaluation, as we saw 
in <A HREF="chapter03-03.html">Lesson 3</A>.  But we can't use 
<CODE>'(READ-DELIMITED-LIST ...)</CODE>; that would suppress evaluation of the 
form we need to evaluate to get the form we need to quote...  Instead, we 
use <CODE>`</CODE> (see <A HREF="chapter03-08.html">Lesson 8</A>) to 
selectively require evaluation within a quoted form.</P>

<P>Our definition of <CODE>OPEN-BRACKET-MACRO-CHARACTER</CODE> uses</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80><CODE>`',<I>form</I></CODE></PRE>

<P>to evaluate <I>form</I> and return the result, quoted.</P>

Lisp reserves six characters for the programmer:<p>

<pre>
 [ ] { } ! ?
</pre> 

You can define any or all of these as macro characters without
interfering with Lisp. However, you should watch out for conflicts if
you share code with other programmers.<p>
