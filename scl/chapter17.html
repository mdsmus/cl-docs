<h1>Chapter 17 - Not All Comparisons are Equal</h1> 

<P>Up to this point, I've shown you various comparison functions without
really saying much about the differences between them. In this chapter,
I'll (finally) tell you about how and why the comparison functions differ
and offer some guidelines for their proper use.

<h2>The longer the test, the more it tells you</h2>

<p>Lisp has a core set of comparison functions that work on virtually
any kind of object.  These are:

<ul>
<li><code>EQ</code> 
<li><code>EQL</code> 
<li><code>EQUAL</code> 
<li><code>EQUALP</code> 
</ul> 

<p>The tests with the shorter names support stricter definitions of
equality. The tests with the longer implement less restrictive, perhaps
more intuitive, definitions of equality.  We'll learn about each of the four
definitions in the following sections.

<h2>EQ is true for identical symbols</h2>

<p><code>EQ</code> is true for identical symbols. In fact, it's true
for any identical object. In other words, an object is
<code>EQ</code> to itself. Even a composite object, such as a list,
is <code>EQ</code> to itself. (But two lists are <em>not</em>
<code>EQ</code> just because they look the same when printed; they
must truly be the <em>same</em> list to be <code>EQ</code>.) Under
the covers, <code>EQ</code> just compares the memory addresses of
objects. 

<p>The reason that symbols are <em>EQ</em> when they have the same
name (and are in the same package) is that the Lisp reader
<em>interns</em> symbols as it reads them. The first time the reader
sees a symbol, it creates it. On subsequent appearances, the reader
simply uses the existing symbol.

<p><code>EQ</code> is not guaranteed to be true for identical
characters or numbers. This is because most Lisp systems don't
assign a unique memory address to a particular number or character;
numbers and characters are generally created as needed and stored
temporarily in the hardware registers of the processor.

<h2>EQL is also true for identical numbers and characters</h2>

<p><code>EQL</code> retains <code>EQ</code>'s notion of equality,
and extends it to identical numbers and characters. Numbers must
agree in value <em>and</em> type; thus 0.0 is <em>not</em>
<code>EQL</code> to 0. Characters must be truly identical;
<code>EQL</code> is case sensitive.

<h2>EQUAL is usually true for things that print the same</h2>

<p><code>EQ</code> and <code>EQL</code> are not generally true for
lists that print the same. Lists that are not <code>EQ</code> but
have the same structure will be indistinguishable when printed; they
will also be <code>EQUAL</code>.

<p>Strings are also considered <code>EQUAL</code> if they print the
same. Like <code>EQL</code>, the comparison of characters within strings
is case-sensitive.

<h2>EQUALP ignores number type and character case</h2>

<p><code>EQUALP</code> is the most permissive of the core comparison
functions. Everything that is <code>EQUAL</code> is also <code>EQUALP</code>.
But <code>EQUALP</code> ignores case distinctions between characters, and 
applies the (typeless) mathematical concept of equality to numbers; thus
0.0 is <code>EQUALP</code> to 0.

<p>Furthermore, <code>EQUALP</code> is true if corresponding elements
are <code>EQUALP</code> in the following composite data types:

<ul>
<li>Arrays
<li>Structures
<li>Hash Tables
</ul> 

<h2>Longer tests are slower; know what you're comparing</h2>

<p>The generality of the above longer-named tests comes with a price.
They must test the types of their arguments to decide what kind of
equality is applicable; this takes time. 

<p><code>EQ</code> is blind to type of an object; either the objects
are the same object, or they're not. This kind of test typically
compiles into one or two machine instructions and is very fast.

<p>You can avoid unnecessary runtime overhead by using the most 
restrictive (shortest-named) test that meets your needs.

<h2>Specialized tests run faster on more restricted data types</h2>

<p>If you know the type of your data in advance, you can use comparisons
that are specialized to test that particular type of data. Tests are 
available for characters, strings, lists, and numbers.  And, of course,
there are also comparisons for other relationships besides equality.
