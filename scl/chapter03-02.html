<h1>Chapter 3 - Essential Lisp in Twelve Lessons</h1> 

<h2><A NAME="lesson-2">Lesson 2 - Essential Evaluation</A></h2> 

<h3>A form is meant to be evaluated</h3> 

<P>A <A NAME="form">form</A> can be either an <A 
HREF="chapter03-01.html#atom">atom</A> or a <A 
HREF="chapter03-01.html#list">list</A>.  The important thing is that the form is 
meant to be <A NAME="evaluated">evaluated</A>.  Evaluation has a fairly 
technical definition that we'll gradually expose in this section.</P>

<P>Evaluation is simple if the form is an atom.  Lisp treats the atom as a 
name, and retrieves the value for the name (if a value exists).  You 
probably wonder why I'm avoiding the more direct explanation of calling the 
atom a variable.  The reason is that the atom can have either a variable 
value or a constant value.  And the atom's value can be constant for a 
couple of reasons.</P>

<P>A number is an atom.  (Its value is constant for obvious reasons.)  Lisp 
does not <EM>store</EM> a value for a number -- the number is said to be 
self-evaluating.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We're going to introduce a new term without a complete definition.  For 
now, think of a <EM>symbol</EM> as an atom that can have a value.  We'll 
look at symbols in greater detail when we get to <A 
HREF="chapter03-05.html">Lesson 5</A>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>A symbol defined in a <CODE>defconstant</CODE> form has a constant 
value.  Lisp will store the value as if the atom had a variable value, and 
add a note to the effect that the value is not allowed to change.</P>

<P>A symbol in the <CODE>KEYWORD</CODE> package is self-evaluating.  We'll 
look at packages in detail in <A HREF="chapter31.html">Chapter 31</A>.  For 
now, all you need to know is that a symbol beginning with the <CODE>:</CODE> 
character (called the package prefix) is a keyword symbol.  Keyword 
symbols have themselves as their values.</P>

<P>A symbol can get a variable value in many different ways.  Lisp actually 
keeps several different values for a symbol.  One has the traditional 
meaning as the value of the symbol taken as a variable.  Another has 
meaning as the symbol's function.  Still others keep track of the symbol's 
documentation, its printed representation, and properties that the 
programmer chooses to associate with the symbol.  We'll explore some of 
these in more detail in <A HREF="chapter03-05.html">Lesson 5</A>, <A 
HREF="chapter03-06.html">Lesson 6</A>, and <A HREF="chapter03-07.html">Lesson 7</A>.</P>

<P>If a form is a list, then the first element must be either a symbol or a 
special form called a lambda expression.  (We won't look at lambda 
expressions for a while.)  The symbol must name a function.  In Lisp, the 
<EM>symbols</EM> <CODE>+</CODE>, <CODE>-</CODE>, <CODE>*</CODE>, and 
<CODE>/</CODE> name the four common arithmetic operations: addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, and division.  Each of these symbols has an 
associated function that performs the arithmetic operation.</P>

<P>So when Lisp evaluates the form <CODE>(+ 2 3)</CODE>, it applies the 
function for addition to the arguments <CODE>2</CODE> and <CODE>3</CODE>, 
giving the expected result <CODE>5</CODE>.  Notice how the function symbol, 
<CODE>+</CODE>, precedes its arguments.  This is <EM>prefix</EM> 
notation.  Any time you see a list, look to its first element to find out 
what Lisp will do to evaluate the list as a form.</P>

<h3>A function is applied to its arguments</h3> 

<P>Lisp, when given a list to evaluate, treats the form as a function call.  
We'll be looking a lot at Lisp evaluation from now on, so we'll use some 
visual aids to identify the input to Lisp and its responses:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80><IMG SRC="gifs/circle-dot.gif" ALT="?" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> the Lisp prompt precedes input to Lisp<br><IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> result of Lisp evaluation</PRE>

<P>For example:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80><IMG SRC="gifs/circle-dot.gif" ALT="?" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> (+ 4 9)<br><IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> 13<br><br><IMG SRC="gifs/circle-dot.gif" ALT="?" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> (- 5 7)<br><IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> -2<br><br><IMG SRC="gifs/circle-dot.gif" ALT="?" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> (* 3 9)<br><IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> 27<br><br><IMG SRC="gifs/circle-dot.gif" ALT="?" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> (/ 15.0 2)<br><IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> 7.5</PRE>

<P>In each case above, the evaluated form is a list.  Its first 
element is a symbol, which names a function.  The remaining elements are 
<EM>arguments</EM> of the function.  Here, the arguments are all numbers, 
and we know that numbers are self-evaluating.</P>

<P>Here are a few more examples:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80><IMG SRC="gifs/circle-dot.gif" ALT="?" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> (atom 123)<br><IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> T<br><br><IMG SRC="gifs/circle-dot.gif" ALT="?" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> (numberp 123)<br><IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> T<br><br><IMG SRC="gifs/circle-dot.gif" ALT="?" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> (atom :foo)<br><IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> T<br><br><IMG SRC="gifs/circle-dot.gif" ALT="?" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> (numberp :foo)<br><IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> NIL</PRE>

<P><CODE>ATOM</CODE> and <CODE>NUMBERP</CODE> are predicates.  Predicates 
return a true or false value.  <CODE>NIL</CODE> is the only false value in 
Lisp -- everything else is true.  Unless a predicate has a more useful 
value to return, it conventionally returns <CODE>T</CODE> to mean true.  
<CODE>ATOM</CODE> returns <code>T</code> if its one argument is a Lisp atom.  
<CODE>NUMBERP</CODE> returns <code>T</code> if its argument is a number.</P>

<P>To evaluate each of the above forms, Lisp first evaluates the arguments 
(from left to right), then evaluates the first element to get its function, 
then applies the function to the arguments.  With only a handful of 
exceptions, which we'll learn about at the end of this lesson, Lisp always 
does the same thing to evaluate a list form:</P>

<A NAME="basic-eval"><OL>
<LI>Evaluate the arguments, from left to right.</LI>
<LI>Get the function associated with the first element.</LI>
<LI>Apply the function to the arguments.</LI>
</OL></A>

<P>Remember that an atom can also be a Lisp form. When given an atom to 
evaluate, Lisp simply returns its value:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80><IMG SRC="gifs/circle-dot.gif" ALT="?" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> 17.95<br><IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> 17.95<br><br><IMG SRC="gifs/circle-dot.gif" ALT="?" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> :A-KEYWORD<br><IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> :A-KEYWORD<br><br><IMG SRC="gifs/circle-dot.gif" ALT="?" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> *FEATURES*<br><IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> (:ANSI-CL :CLOS :COMMON-LISP)<br><br><IMG SRC="gifs/circle-dot.gif" ALT="?" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> "Hello, world!"<br><IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> "Hello, world!"<br><br><IMG SRC="gifs/circle-dot.gif" ALT="?" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> WHAT-IS-THIS?<br><IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow-bar.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> Error: Unbound variable</PRE>

<P>Numbers and keywords are self-evaluating.  So are strings.  The 
<CODE>*FEATURES*</CODE> variable is predefined by Lisp -- your system will 
probably return a different value.</P>

<P>The symbol <CODE>WHAT-IS-THIS?</CODE> doesn't have a value, because it's 
not predefined by Lisp, and I haven't given it a value.  The system 
responds with an error message, rather than a value.  We mark the message 
with <IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow-bar.gif" ALT="-&gt;|" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> 
rather than the <IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> 
marker we use for successful evaluations. Your system will probably print 
a different message.</P>

<h3>A function can return any number of values</h3> 

<P>Sometimes you'd like to have a function return several values. For 
example, a function which looks up a database entry might return both the 
desired result and a completion status code. One way to do this is to 
pass to the function a location for one of the results; this is possible, 
but <STRONG>very</STRONG> uncommon for a Lisp program.</P>

<P>Another approach creates a single return value to combine both the 
result and the status code.  Lisp gives you several different ways to do 
this, including <A HREF="chapter03-10.html#structures">structures</A>.  
Experienced Lisp programmers don't do this when the created value will just 
be taken apart into its components and then forgotten, since the composite 
value then becomes garbage (see <A HREF="chapter29.html">Chapter 29</A>) 
that eventually slows down the operation of the program.</P>

<P>The right way to return multiple values from a function is to use the 
<CODE>VALUES</CODE> form.  We'll see <A 
HREF="chapter03-09.html"><CODE>VALUES</CODE> used in the context of a 
function</A> in a little while.  For now, let's see what happens when Lisp 
evaluates a <CODE>VALUES</CODE> form:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80><IMG SRC="gifs/circle-dot.gif" ALT="?" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> (values 1 2 3 :hi "Hello")<br><IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> 1<br><IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> 2<br><IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> 3<br><IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> :HI
<IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> "Hello"</PRE>

<P>Notice how Lisp returned a value (following the <IMG 
SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> indicator) for 
<EM>each</EM> argument to the <CODE>VALUES</CODE> form.  My Lisp system 
represents this by printing each value on a new line; yours may separate 
the values some other way.</P>

<h3>Arguments are usually not modified by a function</h3> 

<P>I mentioned earlier that you can pass a location to a function, and have 
the function change the location's value.  This is a <EM>very</EM> uncommon 
practice for a Lisp program, even though other languages make it part of their 
standard repertoire.</P>

<P>You could specify the location to be modified as either a non-keyword 
symbol or a composite value -- obviously, you can't modify a constant.  If 
you provide a symbol, then your function must execute code to give the 
symbol a new value.  If you provide a composite data structure, your 
function must execute code to change the correct piece of the composite 
value.  It's harder to write Lisp code to do this, and it's harder to 
understand programs written this way.  So Lisp programmers usually write 
functions that get their inputs from parameters, and produce their outputs 
as the function result.</P>

<h3>Arguments are usually evaluated before function application</h3> 

<P>When Lisp evaluates a function, it always evaluates all the arguments 
first, as we saw <A HREF="#basic-eval">earlier</A>.  Unfortunately, every 
rule has exceptions, and this rule is no exception (as we'll soon see)...  
The problem is not that Lisp doesn't always evaluate a function's 
arguments, but that not every list form is a function call.</P>

<h3>Arguments are evaluated in left-to-right order</h3> 

<P>When a list form <EM>is</EM> a function call, its arguments are always 
evaluated in order, from left to right.  As in other programming 
languages, it's in poor taste to rely on this, but if you absolutely have 
to rely on the order, it's good to know that Lisp defines it for you.</P>

<h3>Special forms and macros change argument evaluation</h3> 

<P>So if a list form isn't always a function call, what else can it be?  
There are two cases, but the result is the same: some arguments are 
evaluated, and some aren't.  Which is which depends upon the form and 
nothing else.  You'll just have to learn the exceptions.  Fortunately, most 
Lisp systems will show you the online documentation for any form with just 
a keystroke or two.</P>

<P>There are two kinds of forms that don't evaluate all of their arguments: 
special forms and macros.  Lisp predefines a small number of special forms.  
You can't add your own special forms -- they're primitive features of the 
language itself.  Lisp also defines quite a few macros.  You can also 
define your own macros.  Macros in Lisp let you use the full power of the 
language to add your own features.  Later in this chapter we'll look 
briefly at <A HREF="chapter03-08.html">how to define simple macros</A>.  In <A 
HREF="chapter20.html">Chapter 20</A> we'll cover topics surrounding the 
creation of more complex macros.</P>
