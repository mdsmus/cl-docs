<h2><A NAME="lesson-6">Lesson 6 - Binding versus Assignment</A></h2> 

<h3>Binding creates a new place to hold a value</h3> 

<P>Lisp often "creates a binding" for a variable by allocating a piece of 
storage to hold the variable's value and putting the value into the newly 
allocated memory.  Binding is a very general mechanism for implementing 
lexical scope for variables, but it has other uses depending upon the 
lifetime of the binding.  We'll revisit this in 
<A HREF="chapter08.html">Chapter 8</A> when we study lifetime and 
visibility.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Yes, Lisp allocates storage for new bindings.  While this sounds like it could
be horribly inefficient, we've said nothing yet about <EM>where</EM> Lisp 
allocated the storage.  For example, Lisp binds function parameters to 
actual values, but allocates the storage on the stack just like any other 
programming language.  Lisp creates bindings in the heap if it can't 
determine that the binding has a lifetime which ends when the binding form 
finishes executing.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<h3>Bindings have names</h3> 

<P>Lisp gives each binding a name.  Otherwise, how would your program 
refer to the binding?  Simple, eh?  Hold on...</P>

<h3>A binding can have different values at the same time</h3> 

<P>It is quite common for multiple bindings to share the same name.  For 
example:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>(let ((a 1))
   (let ((a 2))
      (let ((a 3))
         ...)))</PRE>

<P>Here, <CODE>A</CODE> has three distinct bindings by the time the body 
(marked by <CODE>...</CODE>) executes in the innermost <CODE>LET</CODE>.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is not to say that the above example is representative of typical Lisp 
code, however.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<h3>One binding is innermost</h3> 

<PRE WIDTH=80><I>;; Here, A has no binding.</I>
(let ((a 1))
   <I>;; Here, the innermost binding of A has the value 1.</I>
   (let ((a 2))
      <I>;; Here, the innermost binding of A has the value 2.</I>
      (let ((a 3))
         <I>;; Here, the innermost binding of A has the value 3.</I>
         ...)))</PRE>

<P>As you can see, the notion of innermost binding depends on the relative 
position of your program's code to the form that established a particular 
binding.  If you look at how binding forms are nested (easy to do if you 
indent your code as shown above) then the program has access to bindings 
created around, or enclosing, your program code.</P>

<P>One more thing you should know is that an outer binding is still 
visible through inner binding forms, as long as the inner binding form does 
not bind the same symbol:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80><I>;; Here, A and B have no binding.</I>
(let ((a 1)
      (b 9))
   <I>;; Here, the innermost binding of A has the value 1,
   ;; and the binding of B has the value 9.</I>
   (let ((a 2))
      <I>;; Here, the innermost binding of A has the value 2.
      ;; The binding of B still has the value 9.</I>
      (let ((a 3))
         <I>;; Here, the innermost binding of A has the value 3.
         ;; B still has the value 9 from the outermost LET form.</I>
         ...)))</PRE>

<h3>The program can only access bindings it creates</h3> 

<P>When a binding form binds a new value to an existing symbol, the 
previous value becomes shadowed.  The value of the outer binding is hidden 
(but not forgotten) while your program code executes inside the inner 
binding form.  But as soon as your program leaves the inner binding form, 
the value of the outer binding is restored.  For example:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>(let ((z 1))
   <I>;; Here, the innermost binding of Z has the value 1.</I>
   (let ((z 2))
      <I>;; Here, the innermost binding of Z has the value 2.</I>
      ...)
   <I>;; Now we're outside the inner binding form,
   ;; and we again see the binding with the value 1.</I>
   ...)</PRE>
   
<h3>Assignment gives an old place a new value</h3> 

<P>The <CODE>SETQ</CODE> form changes the value of an existing binding:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>(let ((z 1))
   <I>;; Here, the innermost binding of Z has the value 1.</I>
   (setq z 9)
   <I>;; Now the value of Z is 9.</I>
   (let ((z 2))
      <I>;; Here, the innermost binding of Z has the value 2.</I>
      ...)
   <I>;; Now we're outside the inner binding form,
   ;; and we again see the outer binding of Z with the value 9.</I>
   ...)</PRE>

<P>The <CODE>SETQ</CODE> form above changed the value of the outer binding 
of <CODE>Z</CODE> for the remainder of the outer <CODE>LET</CODE> form.  
This is often the wrong thing to do.  The problem is that you now have to 
look in two places to discover the value of <CODE>Z</CODE> -- first at the 
binding forms, then in the program code for assignments such as 
<CODE>SETQ</CODE>.  While the binding forms are indented by convention 
(many Lisp editors do this as you type), the assignment form, as part of 
the body code of the program, gets no special indentation; this makes it 
harder to spot when you read the program.</P>

<P>We can quite easily avoid the assignment in the previous example by 
introducing a new binding:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>(let ((z 1))
   <I>;; Here, the innermost binding of Z has the value 1.</I>
   (let ((z 9))
      <I>;; Now the value of Z is 9.</I>
      (let ((z 2))
         <I>;; Here, the innermost binding of Z has the value 2.</I>
         ...)
      <I>;; Now we're outside the innermost binding form,
      ;; and we again see the middle binding of Z with the value 9.</I>
      ...)
   <I>;; Here, we see the outermost binding of Z with the value 1.</I>
   ...)</PRE>

<P>Now all of the bindings of <CODE>Z</CODE> are apparent from the 
relative indentation of the <CODE>LET</CODE> forms.  While reading the 
program, all we have to do to find the right binding for <CODE>Z</CODE> at 
any point in our program code (the <CODE>...</CODE> in the example) is to scan 
vertically looking for a <CODE>LET</CODE> form at an outer level of 
indentation.</P>

<P>When a <CODE>SETQ</CODE> form refers to a variable that is not bound by 
an enclosing <CODE>LET</CODE> form, it assigns a value to the global or 
special value of the symbol.  A global value is accessible anywhere it's 
not shadowed, and stays available for as long as the Lisp system runs.  
We'll look at special variables in <A HREF="chapter08.html">Chapter 8</A>.

<PRE WIDTH=80>(setq a 987)
<I>;; Here, A has the global value 987.</I>
(let ((a 1))
   <I>;; Here, the binding of A to the value 1 shadows the global value.</I>
   ...)
<I>;; Now the global value of A is again visible.</I>
...</PRE>
