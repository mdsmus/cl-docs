<h1>Chapter 34 - Lisp History, or: Origins of Misunderstandings</h1> 

<P>I'd like to conclude this book with a short history of Lisp's
development, providing insights to some lingering
misconceptions about Lisp.</P>

<h2>John McCarthy's Notation</h2>

<p>In the late 1950s, John McCarthy had proposed a mathematical
notation to describe recursive functions of symbolic expressions. At
this point, McCarthy clearly envisioned a notation rather than a
programming language. 

<h2>Earliest implementations</h2>

<p>A couple years later Steve Russell, one of McCarthy's students at
MIT, noticed that McCarthy's notation would be easy to interpret on
a computer, and LISP was born. While working on an international
standards committee to define Algol-60, McCarthy proposed numerous
innovations which were not adopted. Perhaps these rejections
prompted McCarthy to gather his ideas into what would become Lisp.
By late 1959, the first complete Lisp interpreter was in use at MIT.

<h2>Special hardware</h2>

<p>In the early days, Lisp consistently outstripped the resources of
its host machines -- mainframes and minicomputers having memory
spaces measured in tens of kilobytes and instruction cycle times
measured in microseconds.  This prompted Lisp researchers to develop
specialized hardware for Lisp program execution.  These machines,
called "Lisp Machines" (or LispMs) spawned an entire industry that
rose in the 1970s and fell during the 1980s.  This industry, and not
the personal computer industry, was the first to sell personal
interactive computers having windowed user interfaces.

<h2>Diverging dialects</h2>

<p>Concurrent with the rise of the LispM industry, many researchers
-- put off by the high costs of the specialized hardware -- engaged
in the development of Lisp implementations for stock hardware.  This
was a time of great diversity and innovation.  However, the profusion
of dialects prevented researchers from readily sharing their work.

<h2>The DARPA directive</h2>

<p>DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, was (and
still is) the funding source for much of the Lisp and AI research
community.  Seeing the problems caused by the explosion in the 
number of distinct Lisp dialects, DARPA sponsored a project to 
develop a unified Common Lisp specification.

<h2>East vs. West, and European competition</h2>

<p>Despite the large number of competing dialects at this time, two
were clearly dominant. On the West coast, Interlisp became the
standard, with its emphasis on programming aids and tools, such as
the aptly named "Do What I Mean."  On the East coast, MACLISP was
de rigueur, with its focus on low-level system programming access
and an efficient compiler.

<p>The Common Lisp effort raised animosities between the two camps,
causing most of the Interlisp advocates to withdraw. Also, political
forces in Europe prompted the formation of additional standardization
efforts, leading to the development of at least one competing (although
quite unsuccessfully) standard.

<h2>The emergence of compilers for stock hardware</h2>

<p>As work began in earnest on the Common Lisp standard, vendors --
most of whom had employees on the standardization committee -- were
quick to implement the recommendations under discussion.  One of the
biggest benefits was the definition of the interface to and behavior
of the Lisp compiler; this, together with advances in compiler and
garbage collector technology, was a first step toward making Lisp
competitive in the arena of general-purpose programming languages.

<h2>The long road to standardization</h2>

<p>The committee produced the first public edition of the Common
LISP specification in 1984. In a shining example of computer
mediated cooperative work, hundreds of LISP users and implementers
exchanged thousands of email messages to propose, debate, and vote
upon each feature of the new language. Each topic and issue was
carefully categorized, indexed, and cross-referenced. Very few areas
were ambiguous or inadequately specified. Because of the extensive
electronic record of the committee's discussions, these remaining
areas were clearly identified and served as a basis for continuing
work by the committee. An interim report of the committee's work was
published in late 1990, and a draft proposed ANSI standard was
published in 1992. The X3.226 ANSI Common Lisp standard was
finalized in December 1994, and formally published about a year
later.

<h2>State of the Art?</h2>

<p>Lisp has been around in various forms for over forty years.
Fortunately, many improvements have been made during that time.
Unfortunately, quite a few people in education and industry still
think of Lisp as it was twenty or more years in the past.

<p>Today, commercial Lisp implementations have compilers that
compete successfully against compilers for lower-level languages
such as C and C++. At the same time, C++ has failed to increase its
expressive power in a way that competes successfully with Common
Lisp.

<p>Java, a newcomer, makes some interesting (yet unfulfilled)
promises about portability and security. Java has strengths in the
areas of system integration, but struggles with performance and
reliability.  I believe that Java will carve out a niche for itself
only by sacrificing some of its stated goals -- which ones remain
to be seen.

<p>Garbage collection, long a favorite whipping post for Lisp
detractors, has advanced to the point where collection delays are
virtually unnoticeable in a well-written Lisp program.  The increasing
trend toward server-based applications actually favors Lisp, since
garbage collection is more efficient and reliable than manual storage
allocation (as with malloc/free) when run for extended periods.

<p>Lisp is still weak on standardized user interfaces, but then so
is every other language and platform. Lisp vendors now sell CORBA
packages for interoperability and a portable (across Lisp
implementations) user interface environment (CLIM). Furthermore, it
is easy to write a simple web server in Lisp, allowing the
development of user interfaces that run in standard web browsers. A
full-featured web server (CL-HTTP) is under continual development at
MIT -- the source code is portable to most Lisp platforms and is
freely available.
