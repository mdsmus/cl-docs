<h1>Chapter 31 - Handling Large Projects in Lisp</h1> 

<P>This book is primarily a tutorial, designed to give you enough of
an understanding of Lisp to get started writing your own programs.
Eventually, you'll find yourself in a situation where you need to
collaborate with other programmers to implement a larger system. The
strategies and tools used to organize Lisp programs for large
projects and team efforts are similar to those used for other
languages. The main difference is that the coordination tools are
part of the same environment in which you develop your program.

<h2>Packages keep your names separate from my names</h2>

<p>One of the first concerns in group development is to avoid
namespace collisions. You don't want to have to poll all the other
programmers to make sure that no one has already used the name
you're planning to give the routine you're about to write. That
would interrupt not only your train of thought, but all the
programmers' as well. The alternative -- to ignore the namespace
problem and resolve collisions during integration -- is even more
unappealing.

<p>One tried and true approach, used in many organizations, is to
give every subsystem a unique prefix for its exported names. Your
job as a programmer is to tack the proper prefix onto the name of
each routine you write for a given subsystem. Like other approaches,
this is both annoying and fragile. Prefixes tend to be abbreviations
(to save typing); system designers tend to be particularly bad at
anticipating future developments -- eventually, you'll have to make
exceptions to the prefix naming rule to accommodate new development,
and with the exceptions comes the extra mental effort of keeping
track of another piece of information which has nothing to do with 
solving a problem.

<p>Object-based languages at least give you a class scope for naming,
but this only pushes the conflict-avoidance strategy somewhere else.

<p>Lisp's package system (see <a href="chapter03-10.html">Chapter 3,
Lesson 10</a>) lets you partition namespaces independent of other
language constructs. If you really want to give each programmer the
freedom to create without the overhead of coordinating on matters
unrelated to problem-solving, you can give each programmer her own
package. As the subsystems are completed, you can integrate by
referring to the qualified names of the public APIs of each
subsystem. Using this approach, there's no cognitive overhead during
subsystem construction, no rework needed during integration, and no
runtime overhead in the delivered product.

<p>The keyword package (remember that keywords are symbols with the
empty package name, such as <code>:FOO</code>) is useful for symbols
that are used only for their identity. Without associated code or
data, a symbol can readily be shared across all subsystems.

<h2>System builders let you describe dependencies</h2>

<p>Lisp does not yet have a standard declarative way to describe the
process of building a system from its source files. Most projects use
one of two approaches:

<ol>
<li>create a system loader based upon <code>LOAD</code> (and sometimes,
<code>COMPILE-FILE</code>) forms
<li>use a homegrown or borrowed declarative system builder
</ol> 

<p>Both approaches have their merits. For smaller systems, a naive
<code>LOAD</code>-based approach is quite workable. As systems get
larger, you'll find increasing pressure to reload the minimum set of
files necessary to update your working Lisp image from changed
sources. And the introduction of macro definitions means that files
which use the macros will have to be reloaded whenever the source
code for a macro definition changes. Eventually, the complexity of
keeping track of these dependencies via ad-hoc loader code will
outweigh the pain of constructing, learning, or adapting a
declarative system builder.

<p>There are several such programs, collectively referred to as
<code>DEFSYSTEM</code>s. Some Lisp vendors include a
<code>DEFSYSTEM</code> with their product. Others are available as
source code from Lisp archive sites. Customization or adaptation is
usually required for the <code>DEFSYSTEM</code>s that are not
vendor-supplied; you would be wise to see whether someone has
already adapted a <code>DEFSYSTEM</code> to your particular
environment.

<p>Later in this chapter, we'll see one more way to keep track of
file dependencies.

<h2>Source control systems keep track of multiple revisions</h2>

<p>Did you ever change a file, save it, and then discover that you
had broken something so badly that you wanted to go back to the previous
version of the file and start over?  A source code control system can
help you do this.

<p>There is no standard for source code control in Lisp, nor is there
likely to be any time soon.  Source code control systems are typically
provided as an essential programming tool independent of the Lisp
environment.  Some Lisp vendors offer a way to operate the source
code control system from the Lisp environment.

<p>For projects involving more than one programmer, a source code
control system offers additional benefits; most such systems allow a
programmer to <em>reserve</em> a file which she intends to edit. A
reserved file can't be edited by any other programmer. Furthermore,
the process of reserving a file usually creates a local editable
copy for the programmer making the changes; the other programmers
see the previous, unedited copy of the file. When the programmer
completes (and, of course, tests) the changes, she returns the
completed file to the source code control system, which makes the
file's new contents available to all the programmers and allows
anyone to reserve the file for a new round of updates.

<p>I highly recommend that you take the time to locate and use a
source code control system. The effort will pay dividends in the
time you don't spend recovering from lost source code changes.

<h2>Modules: another way to describe file dependencies</h2>

<p>Lisp actually does have a rudimentary system of maintaining file
dependencies. I didn't mention the module system earlier because it
is deprecated; it might be removed, replaced, or augmented in some
future revision of the Lisp specification. I also didn't mention the
module system because it has quite limited expressive power. The
module system is best suited for finished, stable systems; it does
not have enough functionality to support incremental program
development in a useful manner.  Given all these caveats, let's take
a brief look at ...

<h2>PROVIDE and REQUIRE</h2>

<p><code>PROVIDE</code> and <code>REQUIRE</code> are the sole
standardized interface to Lisp's module system. A
<code>(REQUIRE</code> <i>name</i><code>)</code> form tells Lisp to
see whether the file associated with <i>name</i> has already been
loaded; if so, <code>REQUIRE</code> does nothing, otherwise it loads
the file. The loaded file must at some point include a top level
form <code>(PROVIDE</code> <i>name</i><code>)</code>; this informs
the module system that the module associated with <i>name</i> has
been loaded.

<p>The means by which the Lisp system locates the file according to
<i>name</i> is implementation-dependent; usually the name maps onto 
a source or object file in the current directory.

<p>The biggest problem with this module system is that it is not
designed to handle incremental program changes; it is better suited
for loading a completed, stable system.  Once a <code>REQUIRE</code>d
file is loaded, it will never be reloaded. (Your vendor may give you
enough information to override this behavior, but you can't depend on
it.)

<p>Of course, if you use an ad-hoc loader or a
<code>DEFSYSTEM</code> during program development, there is little
reason to not to deliver the system using the same approach to
loading. Better yet, some Lisp environments let you dump an image of
your Lisp world, which lets you load the system without having
source or object files at all. Either way, there is no good reason
to use <code>PROVIDE</code> and <code>REQUIRE</code>.
