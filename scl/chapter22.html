<h1>Chapter 22 - How to Find Your Way Around, Part 3</h1> 

<P>In <a href="chapter10.html">Chapter 10</a> we learned about two
functions you can use to examine Lisp objects: <code>DESCRIBE</code> and 
<code>INSPECT</code>. These are available in every implementation, so
you should learn how to use them just in case you find yourself sitting
at a console in front of a new and unknown Lisp system someday.

<p>Some Lisp systems offer additional tools that aren't part of ANSI
Common Lisp. Sometimes the extra tools are built in, and other times
they're provided by the vendor but not installed by default. In this
chapter I'll tell you a bit about these tools, so you'll know what to
look for.

<p>In addition to exploring the structure and relationships of objects,
it's sometimes useful to "hook in" to the behavior of certain functions.
You might just want to know when -- or whether -- a function
is called with certain arguments. <code>TRACE</code> is always at your
disposal (see <a href="chapter16.html">Chapter 16</a>), but you may only
be interested in one particular call out of thousands; generating the
trace output (never mind sifting through it later) can be very time
consuming. For cases like this, some Lisp implementations let you 
<em>advise</em> an existing function without changing its source code.

<h2>Class and method browsers help you find your way in a sea of objects</h2>

<p>When you program a large system using CLOS, especially if the
system evolves over time as so many do, you'll need a tool to help
you examine the relationships between classes. Some Lisp
systems provide a browser that displays these relationships
graphically. Here's an example of what my system's browser displays
as the subclasses of <code>ARRAY</code>:

<p>Another useful tool, the method browser, lets you explore all of
the specializations of a particular method. The browser may let you
filter on particular qualifiers (we learned about qualifiers in <a
href="chapter14.html">Chapter 14</a>), and will almost certainly give
you navigational access to selected method definitions. Here's a
list from the method browser in my Lisp system; I asked for a list
of all <i>INITIALIZE-INSTANCE</i> methods having the
<code>:AROUND</code> qualifier:

<p><img src="gifs/method-browser-list.gif">

<p>Remember that methods do not belong to classes; that's why we
have separate browsers. (Some browsers give you the ability to
navigate the coincidental connections between classes and methods,
such as by examining the classes used to specialize arguments to a
method.)

<h2>ADVISE lets you modify a function's behavior without changing the function</h2>

<p>Some Lisp systems include an <code>ADVISE</code> capability. This
lets you intercept calls to existing functions. You can provide code
that examines (and perhaps alters) the function's arguments and
results. <code>ADVISE</code> has many uses, most of them invented on
the spur of the moment. However, one common use of
<code>ADVISE</code> is to implement a <code>TRACE</code> or
<code>BREAK</code> that is conditioned upon particular arguments or
results.

<p>The syntax and options for <code>ADVISE</code> vary from system to
system. Here's an example of defining advice in one particular 
implementation:

<pre>
(advise fibonacci
        (when (zerop (first arglist)) (break))
        :when :before
        :name :break-on-zero)
</pre> 

<p>This example shows how to advise a <code>FIBONACCI</code>
function by adding code that breaks into the debugger when
<code>FIBONACCI</code>'s first argument is zero. Note that we
do not need any knowledge of or access to the source code of
<code>FIBONACCI</code> in order to add this advice.

<p>This particular implementation of <code>ADVISE</code> binds a
list of all of the advised function's arguments into a variable
named <code>ARGLIST</code>. The keyword arguments declare that the
advice form, <code>(WHEN (ZEROP (FIRST ARGLIST)) (BREAK))</code>, is
to be executed <em>before</em> each call to <code>FIBONACCI</code>.
The advice has the name <code>:BREAK-ON-ZERO</code>; this name is
used when removing advice (typically via an <code>UNADVISE</code>
form) or when redefining the behavior of a particular advice.

<h2>WATCH lets you open a window on interesting variables</h2>

<p>A <em>watch</em> tool, found less commonly on Lisp systems,
allows you to display the current state of a variable as your
program runs. The details vary widely. Implementations may give you
sampled real-time display, or may slow the program down in order to
give you an accurate display of each change. Sometimes the watcher
is integrated with a debugger or stepper, and other times it is an
independent tool. Consult your vendor's documentation to learn
whether your Lisp system has a watch tool.
