<h3>A symbol is just a name</h3> 

<P>A symbol is just a name.  It can stand for itself.  This makes it easy 
to write certain kinds of programs in Lisp.  For example, if you want your 
program to represent relationships in your family tree, you can make a 
database that keeps relationships like this:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>(father John Barry)
(son John Harold)
(father John Susan)
(mother Edith Barry)
(mother Edith Susan)
...</PRE>

<P>Each relationship is a list.  <CODE>(father John Barry)</CODE> means 
that John is Barry's father.  Every element of every list in our database 
is a symbol.  Your Lisp program can compare symbols in this database to 
determine, for example, that Harold is Barry's grandfather.  If you tried 
to write a program like this in another language -- a language without 
symbols -- you'd have to decide how to represent the names of family 
members and relationships, and then create code to perform all the needed 
operations -- reading, printing, comparison, assignment, etc.  This is all 
built into Lisp, because symbols are a data type distinct from the objects 
they might be used to name.</P>

<h3>A symbol is always unique</h3> 

<P>Every time your program uses a symbol, that symbol is 
<EM>identical</EM> to every other symbol with the same name.  You can use 
the <CODE>EQ</CODE> test to compare symbols:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80><IMG SRC="gifs/circle-dot.gif" ALT="?" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> (eq 'a 'a)<br><IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> T<br><br><IMG SRC="gifs/circle-dot.gif" ALT="?" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> (eq 'david 'a)<br><IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> NIL<br><br><IMG SRC="gifs/circle-dot.gif" ALT="?" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> (eq 'David 'DAVID)<br><IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> T<br><br><IMG SRC="gifs/circle-dot.gif" ALT="?" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> (setq zzz 'sleeper)<br><IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> SLEEPER<br><br><IMG SRC="gifs/circle-dot.gif" ALT="?" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> (eq zzz 'sleeper)<br><IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> T</PRE>

<P>Notice that it doesn't matter whether you use uppercase or lowercase 
letters in your symbol names.  Internally, Lisp translates every alphabetic 
character in a symbol name to a common case -- usually upper, but you can 
control this by setting a flag in the Lisp reader.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
When you learn about packages in <A HREF="chapter03-10.html">Lesson 10</A> 
(also see <A HREF="chapter31.html">Chapter 31</A>), you can create symbol 
names that are not identical given the same spelling.  For now, all you 
need to know is that any symbol spelled with a <CODE>:</CODE> gets special 
treatment.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<h3>A symbol can name a value</h3> 

<P>Although the ability for a Lisp symbol to stand for itself is sometimes 
useful, a more common use is for the symbol to name a value.  This is the 
role played by variable and function names in other programming languages.  
A Lisp symbol most commonly names a value or -- when used as the first 
element of a function call form -- a function.</P>

<P>What's unusual about Lisp is that a symbol can have a value as a 
function and a variable at the same time:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80><IMG SRC="gifs/circle-dot.gif" ALT="?" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> (setq first 'number-one)<br><IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> NUMBER-ONE<br><br><IMG SRC="gifs/circle-dot.gif" ALT="?" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> (first (list 3 2 1))<br><IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> 3<br><br><IMG SRC="gifs/circle-dot.gif" ALT="?" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> first<br><IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> NUMBER-ONE</PRE>

<P>Note how <CODE>FIRST</CODE> is used as a variable in the first and last 
case, and as a function (predefined by Lisp, in this example) in the second 
case.  Lisp decides which of these values to use based on where the symbol 
appears.  When the evaluation rule requires a value, Lisp looks for the 
variable value of the symbol.  When a function is called for, Lisp looks 
for the symbol's function.</P>

<P>A symbol can have other values besides those it has as a variable or 
function.  A symbol can also have values for its documentation, property 
list, and print name.  A symbol's documentation is text that you create to 
describe a symbol.  You can create this using the 
<CODE>DOCUMENTATION</CODE> form or as part of certain forms which define a 
symbol's value.  Because a symbol can have multiple meanings, you can 
assign documentation to each of several meanings, for example as a function 
and as a variable.</P>

<P>A property list is like a small database with a single key per entry.  
We'll look at this use of symbols in <A HREF="chapter03-10.html">Lesson 
10</A>.</P>

<P>The print name is what Lisp uses to print the symbol.  You normally 
don't want to change this; if you do, Lisp will print the symbol with a 
different name than it originally used to read the symbol, which will 
create a different symbol when later read by Lisp.</P>

<h3>A value can have more than one name</h3> 

<P>A value can have more than one name.  That is, more than one symbol can 
share a value.  Other languages have pointers that work this way.  Lisp 
does not expose pointers to the programmer, but does have shared objects.  
An object is considered identical when it passes the <CODE>EQ</CODE> 
test.  Consider the following:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80><IMG SRC="gifs/circle-dot.gif" ALT="?" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> (setq L1 (list 'a 'b 'c))<br><IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> (A B C)<br><br><IMG SRC="gifs/circle-dot.gif" ALT="?" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> (setq L2 L1)<br><IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> (A B C)<br><br><IMG SRC="gifs/circle-dot.gif" ALT="?" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> (eq L1 L2)<br><IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> T<br><br><IMG SRC="gifs/circle-dot.gif" ALT="?" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> (setq L3 (list 'a 'b 'c))<br><IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> (A B C)<br><br><IMG SRC="gifs/circle-dot.gif" ALT="?" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> (eq L3 L1)<br><IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> NIL</PRE>

<P>Here, <CODE>L1</CODE> is <CODE>EQ</CODE> to <CODE>L2</CODE> because 
<CODE>L1</CODE> names the <EM>same value</EM> as <CODE>L2</CODE>.  In other 
words, the value created by the <CODE>(LIST 'A 'B 'C)</CODE> form has two 
names, <CODE>L1</CODE> and <CODE>L2</CODE>.  The <CODE>(SETQ L2 L1)</CODE> 
form says, "Make the value of <CODE>L2</CODE> be the value of 
<CODE>L1</CODE>." Not a copy of the the value, but the value.  So 
<CODE>L1</CODE> and <CODE>L2</CODE> <EM>share</EM> the same value -- the 
list <CODE>(A B C)</CODE> which was first assigned as the value of 
<CODE>L1</CODE>.</P>

<P><CODE>L3</CODE> also has a list <CODE>(A B C)</CODE> as its value, but 
it is a <EM>different</EM> list than the one shared by <CODE>L1</CODE> and 
<CODE>L2</CODE>.  Even though the value of <CODE>L3</CODE> <EM>looks</EM> 
the same as the value of <CODE>L1</CODE> and <CODE>L2</CODE>, it is a 
different list because it was created by a different <CODE>LIST</CODE> 
form.  So <CODE>(EQ L3 L1)</CODE><IMG SRC="gifs/right-arrow.gif" 
ALT="-&gt;" ALIGN="BOTTOM"><CODE>NIL</CODE> because their values are 
different lists, each made of the symbols <CODE>A</CODE>, <CODE>B</CODE>, 
and <CODE>C</CODE>.</P>
