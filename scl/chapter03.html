<h1>Chapter 3 - Essential Lisp in Twelve Lessons</h1> 

<P>This chapter will teach you everything you need to know to get started 
with Lisp.  I'll cover all of the core features of the language.  I 
encourage you to think of this core as the Lisp language itself, and 
everything else as a very large standard library.  With this background, 
you'll be much better equipped to learn the rest of Lisp, either by reading 
the rest of the book or via a reference manual such as <CITE>Common Lisp: 
The Language, 2nd Edition</CITE>.</P>

<P>You should read this chapter all the way through.  At times, I mention 
other chapters and later sections of this chapter, but you shouldn't have 
to follow these references to understand this chapter.  When you finish 
this chapter, you should work through <A HREF="chapter04.html">Chapter 
4</A> while sitting at the keyboard of your Lisp system.</P>
