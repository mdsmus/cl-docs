<h1>Chapter 16 - How to Find Your Way Around, Part 2</h1> 

<P>It's once again time to take a break and learn about some more of
the tools you can use to grok <a href="#footnote1">[1]</a> the inner
workings of Lisp and your programs. In this chapter, we'll learn
what the Lisp compiler does to your code, and how to watch what your
code does as it runs.

<h2>DISASSEMBLE: I always wondered what they put inside those things...</h2>

<p>If you understand a little about compilers and assembly language
-- or if you're just interminably curious -- you can find out
exactly <em>how</em> the Lisp compiler translates your Lisp code.
<code>DISASSEMBLE</code> takes a function name or object and lists
the assembly-language instructions that would have been emitted by
the Lisp compiler if it actually emitted assembly-language code --
most compilers directly generate machine instructions without
invoking an assembler.

<p>The output of <code>DISASSEMBLE</code> is dependent both upon the
instruction set architecture of the machine you're using to run Lisp
and upon the Lisp implementation itself.  Here's an example of using
<code>DISASSEMBLE</code> on a very simple function; this was done
using Macintosh Common Lisp on a PowerPC processor.

<pre>
? (defun add1 (n) (1+ n))
ADD1
? (disassemble 'add1)
  (TWNEI NARGS 4)
  (MFLR LOC-PC)
  (BLA .SPSAVECONTEXTVSP)
  (VPUSH ARG_Z)
  (LWZ NARGS 331 RNIL)
  (TWGTI NARGS 0)
  (LI ARG_Y '1)
  (LWZ ARG_Z 0 VSP)
  (BLA .SPRESTORECONTEXT)
  (MTLR LOC-PC)
  (BA .SPBUILTIN-PLUS)
</pre> 

<p>The first thing you'll note about this listing is that it looks
"Lisp-ish" with the parentheses. The second thing you'll notice --
if you are familiar with the PowerPC instruction set -- is that 
most of these forms are familiar; it's as if someone took part of a
real PowerPC assembly language program and bracketed each line of
text in parentheses.  You may also notice that there are no comments
in the assembly code, that there are some pseudo-instructions such
as <code>VPUSH</code>, and that this is not a complete program that
you could feed into an assembler (even after you stripped off the
parentheses). I'll explain all of these points.

<p>Many Lisp systems include an assembler that accepts statements
in the form generated by <code>DISASSEMBLE</code>. These statements
are often named LAP, for Lisp Assembly Program. With the proper 
documentation, you can write LAP code and have it invoked by your
own functions. But you do need the vendor's documentation for this;
you can't just find the LAP assembler and feed it a list of LAP
instructions. You need to know how to use reserved registers, what
subroutines to call, what stack protocol to follow, and many other
low-level details. You also need to associate the code with a function
name so you can call it later; this is one of the pieces that is
missing from the output of <code>DISASSEMBLE</code>.

<p>Some Lisp systems provide additional information (beyond raw
assembler instructions) in their <code>DISASSEMBLE</code> output. In
the code above, you'll see that certain reserved registers or memory
locations are identified by a distinguishing name, such as
<code>NARGS</code>, <code>LOC-PC</code>, <code>ARG_Y</code>,
<code>ARG_Z</code>, <code>VSP</code> and <code>RNIL</code>. Sometimes
certain instructions (or even short instruction sequences) will be
given a mnemonic name that reflects their use by the Lisp compiler;
<code>VPUSH</code> is one such mnemonic used by this Lisp system.

<p>Some Lisp systems are better than others at including explanatory
comments with the disassembled code. Systems that do include comments
typically synthesize comments to explain the code, or save information
that allows <code>DISASSEMBLE</code> to intersperse source program
fragments within the disassembly listing.

<p>One useful thing you can do with <code>DISASSEMBLE</code> is to
see whether <em>declarations</em> have any effect on your compiler.
Declarations are forms that provide <em>advice</em> to the compiler.
With the one exception of the <code>SPECIAL</code> declaration,
which alters the meaning of code that uses it (see <a
href="chapter08.html#special">Chapter 8</a>) a compiler may or may
not use the information that you provide in a declaration. Your Lisp
vendor's documentation may provide some guidance as to the effect of
declarations, but the best (and most accurate) assessment is made by
reading the listing that <code>DISASSEMBLE</code> generates.

<p>The previous disassembly of <code>ADD1</code> shows that it calls
several subroutines: <code>.SPSAVECONTEXTVSP</code>,
<code>.SPRESTORECONTEXT</code>, and <code>.SPBUILTIN-PLUS</code>. If
that seems like an awful lot of work just to add one to a number,
consider that (1) the number can be of any type (including bignum,
which is an "infinite" precision integer type), (2) non-numeric
arguments are handled gracefully -- you'll get a break into the Lisp
debugger rather than a crash or a core dump, and (3) the function
probably makes an extra effort to make its presence known to the
Lisp debugger. 

<p>So, what if we <em>want</em> to play fast and loose, assume that
<code>ADD1</code> will only be called for small integer arguments,
and stoically suffer the ungraceful consequences if we screw up and
pass the wrong type of data? We can add declarations to express our
intent, and then use <code>DISASSEMBLE</code> again to see whether
the compiler paid any attention to our wishes.

<pre>
? (defun int-add1 (n)
    (declare (fixnum n)
             (optimize (speed 3) (safety 0) (debug 0)))
    (the fixnum (1+ n)))
INT-ADD1
? (disassemble 'int-add1)
  (MFLR LOC-PC)
  (STWU SP -16 SP)
  (STW FN 4 SP)
  (STW LOC-PC 8 SP)
  (STW VSP 12 SP)
  (MR FN TEMP2)
  (LWZ IMM0 -117 RNIL)
  (TWLLT SP IMM0)
  (VPUSH ARG_Z)
  (LWZ ARG_Z 0 VSP)
  (ADDI ARG_Z ARG_Z 4)
  (LWZ LOC-PC 8 SP)
  (MTLR LOC-PC)
  (LWZ VSP 12 SP)
  (LWZ FN 4 SP)
  (LA SP 16 SP)
  (BLR)
</pre> 

<p>The <code>DECLARE</code> form in <code>INT-ADD1</code> includes
two kinds of advice. <code>(FIXNUM N)</code> declares that the
function parameter <code>N</code> is a small integer. (The range
depends upon your Lisp implementation, but you'll typically get
29-bit fixnums on a 32-bit processor; the remaining three bits are
often used by the Lisp system to encode type information.) The
<code>(OPTIMIZE ...</code> declaration is advice to the compiler
that you'd like it to emphasize certain properties of the compiled
code. Here, I've said that speed is of ultimate importance, and that
I could care less about runtime safety or debuggability. If the
compiler pays attention to all of this, I should get code that is
optimized for fixnums, runs fast, and falls over if I pass it
anything other than a fixnum or cause it to generate a result that
isn't a fixnum.

<p>Looking at the generated code, it appears that the compiler
<em>has</em> paid attention to my declarations. The compiled code
for <code>INT-ADD1</code> is a bit longer than the code for
<code>ADD1</code>, but there are <em>no</em> subroutine calls. Every
instruction generated for <code>INT-ADD1</code> is a simple PowerPC
instruction (even the <code>VPUSH</code> instruction, which is just
an alias for a single PowerPC instruction). The addition is
performed by PowerPC instructions instead of a subroutine. In fact,
most of the code in <code>INT-ADD1</code> has to do with entering
and leaving the function.

<p>By the way, <em>some</em> optimization setting is always in effect
if you don't use an <code>(OPTIMIZE ...</code> declaration. To find out
what are the global optimization settings, do this:

<pre>
? (declaration-information 'optimize)
((SPEED 1) (SAFETY 1) (COMPILATION-SPEED 1) (SPACE 1) (DEBUG 1))
</pre> 

<blockquote> <code>DECLARATION-INFORMATION</code> may not exist in a
pre-ANSI Common Lisp implementation, but there may be an alternative
way to access this information. Consult the vendor's documentation.
If that fails, see whether <code>APROPOS</code> (see <a
href="chapter10.html">Chapter 10</a>) turns up anything that might
be useful. </blockquote> 

<h2>BREAK and backtrace: How did I end up here?</h2>

<p>If you ever need to figure out <em>exactly</em> what's going on
at a particular point in your program, you can insert a
<code>BREAK</code> form at the point of interest; when your program
evaluates the <code>BREAK</code>, the Lisp system will immediately
stop your program (without losing any information), and transfer
control to the Lisp debugger. Once in the debugger, you can do
things like examine the call stack (sometimes named a backtrace,
since the stack frames are a trace of your program's current call
history, backward in time) and look at local variables at any level
in the stack. And, of course, you can execute any Lisp code that you
like. But wait, there's more! You can exit the debugger, and your
program will continue from where the <code>BREAK</code> interrupted
it. Or you can change the values of some variables before you
continue. If you want, you can provide a value to be returned by the
interrupted function. You can even redefine and restart functions
anywhere in the call stack.

<p>The fact that <code>BREAK</code> is just a Lisp form has its
advantages. You can wrap it in a conditional expression of arbitrary
complexity, so that your program will trigger the break exactly when
it's needed; this is especially useful in debugging loops or recursive
functions.

<p>If you have more than one <code>BREAK</code> statement in your
code, you may find it useful to identify the particular
<code>BREAK</code> that invokes the debugger. You can provide a
format control string and arguments that <code>BREAK</code> will use
to print a message upon entry to the debugger. The control string
and arguments are the same as you'd use for <code>FORMAT</code>.
(We've seen examples of <code>FORMAT</code> in Chapters <a
href="chapter04.html">4</a>, <a href="chapter05.html">5</a>, and <a
href="chapter06.html">6</a>. <a href="chapter24.html">Chapter 24</a>
give a a more complete treatment of <code>FORMAT</code>.)

<blockquote>
The downside?  Most Lisp IDE's don't give you a point-and-click
interface to set <code>BREAK</code>s. (That <em>is</em> a downside,
right?)
</blockquote> 

<p>Lisp defines <code>BREAK</code>, the interface for your program
to gain entry into the debugger. Once there, the commands that
you'll use to navigate are <em>entirely</em>
implementation-specific. If you're lucky, you'll get a
window-and-menus interface to at least the most common actions. If,
instead of a GUI, the debugger presents you with just get a message
and a prompt, you may have to crack open the manual. But before you
get so desperate, try to get the debugger to print a help text or
menu: one of the commands <code>H</code>, <code>?</code>,
<code>:H</code>, or <code>:HELP</code> may work for your Lisp
system.

<h2><a name="trace-and-step">TRACE and STEP: I'm watching you!</a> </h2>

<p>When you need to know exactly <em>how</em> a function is working
at a particular point in your code, <code>BREAK</code> and the Lisp
debugger are indispensable tools. But they are labor intensive and
slow (at least relative to the program's normal execution) --
nothing happens except when you issue commands to the debugger. 

<p>Sometimes, it's enough to know that a particular function has
been called and returned a value. <code>TRACE</code> gives you this
ability.  You simply invoke trace with one or more function names,
and the Lisp environment arranges to print the name of the function
and its arguments upon entry, and the name of the function and its
values upon exit. All this happens without changing the source code
for the function.

<pre>
? (defun factorial (n)
    (if (plusp n)
      (* n (factorial (1- n)))
      1))
FACTORIAL
? (factorial 6)
720
? (trace factorial)
NIL
? (factorial 6)
 Calling (FACTORIAL 6) 
  Calling (FACTORIAL 5) 
   Calling (FACTORIAL 4) 
    Calling (FACTORIAL 3) 
     Calling (FACTORIAL 2) 
      Calling (FACTORIAL 1) 
       Calling (FACTORIAL 0) 
       FACTORIAL returned 1
      FACTORIAL returned 1
     FACTORIAL returned 2
    FACTORIAL returned 6
   FACTORIAL returned 24
  FACTORIAL returned 120
 FACTORIAL returned 720
720
</pre> 

<blockquote> Some Lisp systems may print only the first and last
lines of this trace, because of compiler optimizations. If you want
to see recursive calls, it may help to evaluate <code>(DECLAIM
(OPTIMIZE (DEBUG 3)))</code> before defining any functions to be
traced. </blockquote> 

<p>Notice how indentation is used to represent call stack depth.
This, and other details of the <code>TRACE</code> presentation, are
implementation dependent.

<p>When you no longer want to trace a function, evaluate
<code>UNTRACE</code>, passing the function name (or names).
<code>UNTRACE</code> without any arguments will stop tracing of all
currently traced functions.

<p>Sometimes, despite your best efforts, you're just not sure what
parts of a function are being executed. If you're this confused, and
you'd rather forge ahead than try to simplify the function, Lisp
gives you the <code>STEP</code> form. <code>STEP</code> takes a
complete Lisp form as an argument; it evaluates the form and returns
what the form returns. Along the way, though, it lets you see all of
the evaluations that happen -- step by step, as it were. Like
<code>BREAK</code>, <code>STEP</code> only has a standard program
interface; the user interface is implementation dependent.

<blockquote> The quality of information available through
<code>STEP</code> varies widely among implementations. The most
common shortcoming is that you see some transformed version of the
program source, rather than the original source code. Generally,
you'll be able to spot enough clues (variable names, functions,
etc.) so that you can keep your bearings as you execute the stepped
code one form at a time. </blockquote>
