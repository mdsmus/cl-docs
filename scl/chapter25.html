<h1>Chapter 25 - Connecting Lisp to the Real World</h1> 

<P>Lisp provides a wonderful development environment, as we'll see
in the next few chapters.  But Lisp would be of little value for 
some applications without a way to access external programs written
in other languages.  Fortunately, modern Lisp implementations have
a Foreign Function Interface, or FFI for short.

<p>In this chapter I'll describe FFI in general terms.
Implementations differ in the details since FFI has not (yet) been
standardized. Despite the lack of standardization, current
implementations seem to have converged on a similar set of features.

<h2>Foreign Function Interfaces let you talk to programs written in "foreign languages"</h2>

<p>An FFI lets your Lisp program interact with code that is "foreign" --
i.e. not Lisp. 

<blockquote>
This Lisp-centric view of the world is probably motivated
by the Lisp machines, where everything -- even the low-level portions of
the OS -- was written in Lisp. A good many of the people involved with
Lisp during that time are responsible as well for the development of
modern Lisp implementations; hence, the not-so-subtle nod toward the
notion of Lisp as the center of the programmer's universe.
</blockquote> 

<p>A typical FFI provides for both calls from Lisp to separately-compiled
code, and from separately compiled code to Lisp.  (In the latter case, it
is almost always true that the external code must have been called from
Lisp; it can then call back into Lisp.)  Most often, an FFI supports a 
C calling convention.

<h2>Would you wrap this, please?</h2>

<p>Why is an FFI even necessary? Why can't you link-in separately
compiled code as in any other language? The main reason is that Lisp
datatypes don't generally have equivalents in conventional
languages. For example, C integers typically fill (depending upon
declaration) one-half, one, or two machine words and produce
mathematically incorrect results when a result exceeds the
representational capacity of the integer's storage. A Lisp integer
can fit in a machine word, saving a few bits for a type tag. These
are called fixnums. Lisp integers having magnitudes exceeding the
capacity of the single word representation are converted to a
representation that has an unlimited number of bits -- these are
bignums. And with a good compiler, you can define subtypes of
integers that, when packed into an array, have just enough bits in
their representation to handle the declared range of values.

<p>So, one purpose of an FFI is to translate Lisp datatypes to (and
from) "foreign" datatypes.  Not all conversions are possible -- a good
FFI will signal an error when a conversion is not possible at runtime.

<p>When a non-Lisp function accepts or returns values in a record
datatype, the FFI must provide a means of constructing appropriate
records.  Typically, the FFI gives you a way to construct records
that are bit-for-bit identical to those that would have been produced
by another language.  Fields within a record are set and retrieved
using specialized Lisp accessors.

<p>An FFI must also support the proper function calling protocol for
non-Lisp functions. Protocols differ by platform and by language.
Lisp function calling conventions normally differ from those used by
other languages. Lisp supports optional, keyword, default, and rest
parameters, multiple return values, closures, and (sometimes,
depending upon the compiler) tail call elimination; a conventional
language might implement tail call elimination.

<p>What else must an FFI do?  It loads object files produced by other
languages, providing linker functionality within Lisp for these object 
files.  A linker resolves named entries to code in the object file, and
fills in machine addresses in the object code depending upon where the
code loads into memory.

<p>Finally, an FFI must resolve differences in memory allocation between
Lisp and other languages.  Most Lisp implementations allow objects to
move during operation; this improves the long-term efficiency of memory
management and can improve the performance of the program under virtual
memory implementations by reducing the size of the working set.
Unfortunately, most other languages expect objects to remain at a fixed
memory address during program execution.  So the FFI must arrange for a
foreign function to see Lisp objects that don't move.

<p>All of the above functionality is encapsulated by an FFI wrapper 
function.  All you have to do is define the name, calling sequence and
object code file of some foreign function, and the FFI will generate
a wrapper that does all of the necessary translations.  Once you've
done this, the foreign function can be called just like any other Lisp
function.

<h2>I'll call you back...</h2>

<p>Usually a foreign function is called for its results or to have some
effect on the external environment, and a simple call/return sequence 
is all that's needed.  But some foreign functions, particularly
those that deal with user interface or device I/O, require access to 
<em>callback functions</em> during their operation.  A callback function
is called <em>from</em> the foreign function.  

<p>To define a callback function in Lisp, the FFI basically has to solve
all of the foreign function problems in the reverse direction.  You use
the FFI to define a Lisp function that is callable from another language.
The result is typically a function object or pointer that can be passed
(as a parameter) to a call of a foreign function.  When the foreign
function is called, it references the callback parameter in the normal
manner to invoke the Lisp callback function.  The FFI wrapper around the
callback translates the foreign calling sequence and parameter values to
the corresponding Lisp format, invokes the Lisp callback function, and
returns the callback's results after suitable translation from Lisp to 
foreign formats.

<h2>Network Interfaces: beyond these four walls</h2>

<p>Although network protocols are hightly standardized and interoperable,
networking APIs are not.  Common Lisp vendors usually provide their own
interface to the target platform's networking software.  Franz's Allegro
Common Lisp provides a simple sockets library for IP networking.  Digitool's
Macintosh Common Lisp comes with a complete set of interfaces to the low-level
networking APIs (IP, AppleTalk and PPC) of the Mac OS, plus a collection of 
sample code that uses the low-level calls to perform common networking tasks;
you can use the samples as-is or customize them to your requirements.
