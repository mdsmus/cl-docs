<h2>The object model of asdf</h2>

<p>asdf is designed in an object-oriented way from the ground up.  Both a
system's structure and the operations that can be performed on systems
follow a protocol.  asdf is extensible to new operations and to new
component types.  This allows the addition of behaviours: for example,
a new component could be added for Java JAR archives, and methods
specialised on <code>compile-op</code> added for it that would accomplish the
relevant actions.

<p>This chapter deals with <em>components</em>, the building blocks of a
system, and <em>operations</em>, the actions that can be performed on a
system.
