<h2>TODO list</h2>

<p>* Outstanding spec questions, things to add

<p>** packaging systems

<p>*** manual page component?

<p>** style guide for .asd files

<p>You should either use keywords or be careful with the package that you
evaluate defsystem forms in.  Otherwise (defsystem partition ...) 
being read in the cl-user package will intern a cl-user:partition
symbol, which will then collide with the partition:partition symbol.

<p>Actually there's a hairier packages problem to think about too. 
in-order-to is not a keyword: if you read defsystem forms in a package
that doesn't use ASDF, odd things might happen

<p>** extending defsystem with new options

<p>You might not want to write a whole parser, but just to add options to
the existing syntax.  Reinstate parse-option or something akin

<p>** document all the error classes

<p>** what to do with compile-file failure

<p>Should check the primary return value from compile-file and see if
that gets us any closer to a sensible error handling strategy

<p>** foreign files

<p>lift unix-dso stuff from db-sockets

<p>** Diagnostics

<p>A "dry run" of an operation can be made with the following form:

<br><pre>(traverse (make-instance '&lt;operation-name&gt;)
          (find-system &lt;system-name&gt;)
          'explain)
</pre>

<p>This uses unexported symbols.  What would be a nice interface for this
functionality?
