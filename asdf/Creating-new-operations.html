<h4>Creating new operations</h4>

<p>asdf was designed to be extensible in an object-oriented fashion.  To
teach asdf new tricks, a programmer can implement the behaviour he
wants by creating a subclass of <code>operation</code>.

<p>asdf's pre-defined operations are in no way "privileged", but it is
requested that developers never use the <code>asdf</code> package for
operations they develop themselves.  The rationale for this rule is
that we don't want to establish a "global asdf operation name
registry", but also want to avoid name clashes.

<p>An operation must provide methods for the following generic functions
when invoked with an object of type <code>source-file</code>:  <em>FIXME describe
this better</em>

<ul>

<li><code>output-files</code>
<li><code>perform</code>
The <code>perform</code> method must call <code>output-files</code> to find out
where to put its files, because the user is allowed to override
<li><code>output-files</code> for local policy <code>explain</code>
<li><code>operation-done-p</code>, if you don't like the default one

</ul>
