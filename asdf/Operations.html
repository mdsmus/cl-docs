<h3>Operations</h3>

<p>An <dfn>operation</dfn> object of the appropriate type is instantiated
whenever the user wants to do something with a system like

<ul>
<li>compile all its files
<li>load the files into a running lisp environment
<li>copy its source files somewhere else
</ul>

<p>Operations can be invoked directly, or examined to see what their
effects would be without performing them.  <em>FIXME: document how!</em>  There
are a bunch of methods specialised on operation and component type
that actually do the grunt work.

<p>The operation object contains whatever state is relevant for this
purpose (perhaps a list of visited nodes, for example) but primarily
is a nice thing to specialise operation methods on and easier than
having them all be EQL methods.

<p>Operations are invoked on systems via <code>operate</code>.

<code>operate</code> invokes <var>operation</var> on <var>system</var>.  <code>oos</code>
is a synonym for <code>operate</code>.

<p><var>operation</var> is a symbol that is passed, along with the supplied
<var>initargs</var>, to <code>make-instance</code> to create the operation object. 
<var>system</var> is a system designator.

<p>The initargs are passed to the <code>make-instance</code> call when creating
the operation object.  Note that dependencies may cause the operation
to invoke other operations on the system or its components: the new
operations will be created with the same initargs as the original one.
