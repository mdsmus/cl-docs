<h3>A more involved example</h3>

<p>Let's illustrate some more involved uses of <code>defsystem</code> via a
slightly convoluted example:

<br><pre>(defsystem "foo"
  :version "1.0"
  :components ((:module "foo" :components ((:file "bar") (:file"baz")
                                           (:file "quux"))
	        :perform (compile-op :after (op c)
			  (do-something c))
		:explain (compile-op :after (op c)
			  (explain-something c)))
               (:file "blah")))
</pre>

<p>The method-form tokens need explaining: essentially, this part:

<br><pre>	        :perform (compile-op :after (op c)
			  (do-something c))
		:explain (compile-op :after (op c)
			  (explain-something c))
</pre>

<p>has the effect of

<br><pre>(defmethod perform :after ((op compile-op) (c (eql ...)))
	   (do-something c))
(defmethod explain :after ((op compile-op) (c (eql ...)))
	   (explain-something c))
</pre>

<p>where <code>...</code> is the component in question; note that although this
also supports <code>:before</code> methods, they may not do what you want
them to - a <code>:before</code> method on perform <code>((op compile-op) (c
(eql ...)))</code>  will run after all the dependencies and sub-components
have been processed, but before the component in question has been
compiled.
