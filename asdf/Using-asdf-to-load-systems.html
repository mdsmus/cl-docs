<h2>Using asdf to load systems</h2>

<p>This chapter describes how to use asdf to compile and load ready-made
Lisp programs and libraries.

<h3>Setting up asdf</h3>

<p>The single file <code>asdf.lisp</code> is all you need to use asdf normally. 
Once you load it in a running Lisp, you're ready to use asdf.  For
maximum convenience you might want to have asdf loaded whenever you
start your Lisp implementation, for example by loading it from the
startup script or dumping a custom core - check your Lisp
implementation's manual for details.

<p>The variable <code>asdf:*central-registry*</code> is a list of "system
directory designators"<a rel=footnote href="#fn-1"><sup>1</sup></a>. 
A <dfn>system directory designator</dfn> is a form which will be evaluated
whenever a system is to be found, and must evaluate to a directory to
look in.  You might want to set <code>*central-registry*</code> in your Lisp
init file, for example:

<br><pre>(setf asdf:*central-registry*
  '(*default-pathname-defaults*
    #p"/home/me/cl/systems/"
    #p"/usr/share/common-lisp/systems/"))
</pre>

<h3>Setting up a system to be loaded</h3>

<p>To compile and load a system, you need to ensure that a symlink to its
system definition is in one of the directories in
<code>*central-registry*</code><a rel=footnote href="#fn-2"><sup>2</sup></a>.

<p>For example, if <code>#p"/home/me/cl/systems/"</code> (note the trailing
slash) is a member of <code>*central-registry*</code>, you would set up a
system <var>foo</var> that is stored in a directory
<code>/home/me/src/foo/</code> for loading with asdf with the following
commands at the shell (this has to be done only once):

<br><pre>$ cd /home/me/cl/systems/
$ ln -s ~/src/foo/foo.asd .
</pre>

<h3>Loading a system</h3>

<p>The system <var>foo</var> is loaded (and compiled, if necessary) by
evaluating the following form in your Lisp implementation:

<br><pre>(asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op '<var>foo</var>)
</pre>

<p>That's all you need to know to use asdf to load systems written by
others.  The rest of this manual deals with writing system
definitions for Lisp software you write yourself.

<hr><h4>Footnotes</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><a name="fn-1"></a>
<p>When we say ``directory'' here, we mean
``designator for a pathname with a supplied DIRECTORY component''.</p>

<li><a name="fn-2"></a>
<p>It is possible to customize the
system definition file search.  That's considered advanced use, and
covered later: search forward for
<code>*system-definition-search-functions*</code>.  See <a href="Defining-systems-with-defsystem.html#Defining%20systems%20with%20defsystem">Defining systems with defsystem</a>.</p>
