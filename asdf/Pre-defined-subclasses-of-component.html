<p>A source file is any file that the system does not know how to
generate from other components of the system.

<p>Note that this is not necessarily the same thing as "a file
containing data that is typically fed to a compiler".  If a file is
generated by some pre-processor stage (e.g. a <code>.h</code> file from
<code>.h.in</code> by autoconf) then it is not, by this definition, a source
file.  Conversely, we might have a graphic file that cannot be
automatically regenerated, or a proprietary shared library that we
received as a binary: these do count as source files for our purposes.

<p>Subclasses of source-file exist for various languages.  <em>FIXME:
describe these.</em>

<p>A module is a collection of sub-components.

<p>A module component has the following extra initargs:

<ul>
<li><code>:components</code> the components contained in this module

<li><code>:default-component-class</code> All child components which don't
specify their class explicitly are inferred to be of this type.

<li><code>:if-component-dep-fails</code> This attribute takes one of the values
<code>:fail</code>, <code>:try-next</code>, <code>:ignore</code>, its default value is
<code>:fail</code>.  The other values can be used for implementing
conditional compilation based on implementation <code>*features*</code>, for
the case where it is not necessary for all files in a module to be
compiled.

<li><code>:serial</code> When this attribute is set, each subcomponent of this
component is assumed to depend on all subcomponents before it in the
list given to <code>:components</code>, i.e. all of them are loaded before
a compile or load operation is performed on it.

</ul>

<p>The default operation knows how to traverse a module, so most
operations will not need to provide methods specialised on modules.

<p><code>module</code> may be subclassed to represent components such as
foreign-language linked libraries or archive files.

<p><code>system</code> is a subclass of <code>module</code>.

<p>A system is a module with a few extra attributes for documentation
purposes; these are given elsewhere.  See <a href="The-defsystem-grammar.html#The%20defsystem%20grammar">The defsystem grammar</a>.

<p>Users can create new classes for their systems: the default
<code>defsystem</code> macro takes a <code>:classs</code> keyword
argument.
