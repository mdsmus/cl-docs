<h3>The defsystem grammar</h3>

<pre>
system-definition := ( defsystem system-designator {option}* )

option := :components component-list
        | :pathname pathname
        | :default-component-class
        | :perform method-form 
        | :explain method-form
	| :output-files  method-form
        | :operation-done-p method-form
        | :depends-on ( {simple-component-name}* ) 
	| :serial [ t | nil ]
        | :in-order-to ( {dependency}+ )

component-list := ( {component-def}* )
                
component-def  := simple-component-name
                | ( component-type name {option}* )

component-type := :module | :file | :system | other-component-type

dependency := (dependent-op {requirement}+)
requirement := (required-op {required-component}+)
             | (feature feature-name)
dependent-op := operation-name
required-op := operation-name | feature
</pre>

<h4>Serial dependencies</h4>

<p>If the <code>:serial t</code> option is specified for a module, asdf will add
dependencies for each each child component, on all the children
textually preceding it.  This is done as if by <code>:depends-on</code>.

<br><pre>:components ((:file "a") (:file "b") (:file "c"))
:serial t
</pre>

<p>is equivalent to

<br><pre>:components ((:file "a")
	     (:file "b" :depends-on ("a"))
	     (:file "c" :depends-on ("a" "b")))
</pre>

<h4>Source location</h4>

<p>The <code>:pathname</code> option is optional in all cases for systems
defined via <code>defsystem</code>, and in the usual case the user is
recommended not to supply it.

<p>Instead, asdf follows a hairy set of rules that are designed so that
<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li><code>find-system</code> will load a system from disk and have its pathname
default to the right place
<li>this pathname information will not be
overwritten with <code>*default-pathname-defaults*</code> (which could be
somewhere else altogether) if the user loads up the <code>.asd</code> file
into his editor and interactively re-evaluates that form.
</ol>

<p>If a system is being loaded for the first time, its top-level pathname
will be set to:

<ul>
<li>The host/device/directory parts of <code>*load-truename*</code>, if it is bound
<li><code>*default-pathname-defaults*</code>, otherwise
</ul>

<p>If a system is being redefined, the top-level pathname will be

<ul>
<li>changed, if explicitly supplied or obtained from
<code>*load-truename*</code> (so that an updated source location is
reflected in the system definition)
<li>changed if it had previously been set from
<code>*default-pathname-defaults*</code>
<li>left as before, if it had previously been set from
<code>*load-truename*</code> and <code>*load-truename*</code> is currently
unbound (so that a developer can evaluate a <code>defsystem</code> form from
within an editor without clobbering its source location)
</ul>
