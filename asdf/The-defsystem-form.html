<h3>The defsystem form</h3>

<p>Systems can be constructed programmatically by instantiating
components using make-instance.  Most of the time, however, it is much
more practical to use a static <code>defsystem</code> form.  This section
begins with an example of a system definition, then gives the full
grammar of <code>defsystem</code>.

<p>Let's look at a simple system:

<br><pre>(defsystem "hello-lisp"
    :description "hello-lisp: a sample Lisp system."
    :version "0.2"
    :author "Joe User &lt;joe@example.com&gt;"
    :licence "Public Domain"
    :components ((:file "packages")
                 (:file "macros" :depends-on ("packages"))
                 (:file "hello" :depends-on ("macros"))))
</pre>

<p>Some notes about this example:

<ul>
<li>This form defines a system named "hello-lisp" that contains three
source files: <code>packages</code>, <code>macros</code> and <code>hello</code>.

<li>The file <code>macros</code> depends on <code>packages</code> (presumably because
the package it's in is defined in <code>packages</code>), and the file
<code>hello</code> depends on <code>macros</code> (and hence, transitively on
<code>packages</code>).  This means that asdf will compile and load
<code>packages</code> and <code>macros</code> before starting the compilation of
file <code>hello</code>.

<li>The files are located in the same directory as the file with the
system definition.  asdf resolves symlinks before loading the system
definition file and stores its location in the resulting
system<a rel=footnote href="#fn-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  This is a good thing because the user can
move the system sources without having to edit the system definition.

</ul>

<hr><h4>Footnotes</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><a name="fn-1"></a>
<p>It is possible, though almost never necessary, to
override this behaviour.</p>
