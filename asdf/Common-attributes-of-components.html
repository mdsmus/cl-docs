<h4>Common attributes of components</h4>

<p>All components, regardless of type, have the following attributes. 
All attributes except <code>name</code> are optional.

<h5>Name</h5>

<p>A component name is a string or a symbol.  If a symbol, its name is
taken and lowercased.  The name must be a suitable value for the
<code>:name</code> initarg to <code>make-pathname</code> in whatever filesystem
the system is to be found.

<p>The lower-casing-symbols behaviour is unconventional, but was selected
after some consideration.  Observations suggest that the type of
systems we want to support either have lowercase as customary case
(Unix, Mac, windows) or silently convert lowercase to uppercase
(lpns), so this makes more sense than attempting to use <code>:case
:common</code> as argument to <code>make-pathname</code>, which is reported not to
work on some implementations

<h5>Version identifier</h5>

<p>This optional attribute is used by the test-system-version
operation. See <a href="Predefined-operations-of-asdf.html#Predefined%20operations%20of%20asdf">Predefined operations of asdf</a>.  For the default method of
test-system-version, the version should be a string of intergers
separated by dots, for example <code>1.0.11</code>.

<h5>Required features</h5>

<p>Traditionally defsystem users have used reader conditionals to include
or exclude specific per-implementation files.  This means that any
single implementation cannot read the entire system, which becomes a
problem if it doesn't wish to compile it, but instead for example to
create an archive file containing all the sources, as it will omit to
process the system-dependent sources for other systems.

<p>Each component in an asdf system may therefore specify features using
the same syntax as #+ does, and it will (somehow) be ignored for
certain operations unless the feature conditional is a member of
<code>*features*</code>.

<h5>Dependencies</h5>

<p>This attribute specifies dependencies of the component on its
siblings.  It is optional but often necessary.

<p>There is an excitingly complicated relationship between the initarg
and the method that you use to ask about dependencies

<p>Dependencies are between (operation component) pairs.  In your
initargs for the component, you can say

<br><pre>:in-order-to ((compile-op (load-op "a" "b") (compile-op "c"))
	      (load-op (load-op "foo")))
</pre>

<p>This means the following things:
<ul>
<li>before performing compile-op on this component, we must perform
load-op on <var>a</var> and <var>b</var>, and compile-op on <var>c</var>,
<li>before performing <code>load-op</code>, we have to load <var>foo</var>
</ul>

<p>The syntax is approximately

<pre>
(this-op {(other-op required-components)}+)

required-components := component-name
                     | (required-components required-components)

component-name := string
                | (:version string minimum-version-object)
</pre>

<p>Side note:

<p>This is on a par with what ACL defsystem does.  mk-defsystem is less
general: it has an implied dependency

<pre>
  for all x, (load x) depends on (compile x)
</pre>

<p>and using a <code>:depends-on</code> argument to say that <var>b</var> depends on
<var>a</var> <em>actually</em> means that

<pre>
  (compile b) depends on (load a) 
</pre>

<p>This is insufficient for e.g. the McCLIM system, which requires that
all the files are loaded before any of them can be compiled ]

<p>End side note

<p>In asdf, the dependency information for a given component and
operation can be queried using <code>(component-depends-on operation
component)</code>, which returns a list

<br><pre>((load-op "a") (load-op "b") (compile-op "c") ...)
</pre>

<p><code>component-depends-on</code> can be subclassed for more specific
component/operation types: these need to <code>(call-next-method)</code> and
append the answer to their dependency, unless they have a good reason
for completely overriding the default dependencies

<p>(If it weren't for CLISP, we'd be using a <code>LIST</code> method
combination to do this transparently.  But, we need to support CLISP. 
If you have the time for some CLISP hacking, I'm sure they'd welcome
your fixes)

<h5>pathname</h5>

<p>This attribute is optional and if absent will be inferred from the
component's name, type (the subclass of source-file), and the location
of its parent.

<p>The rules for this inference are:

<p>(for source-files)
<ul>
<li>the host is taken from the parent
<li>pathname type is <code>(source-file-type component system)</code>
<li>the pathname case option is <code>:local</code>
<li>the pathname is merged against the parent
</ul>

<p>(for modules)
<ul>
<li>the host is taken from the parent
<li>the name and type are <code>NIL</code>
<li>the directory is <code>(:relative component-name)</code>
<li>the pathname case option is <code>:local</code>
<li>the pathname is merged against the parent
</ul>

<p>Note that the DEFSYSTEM operator (used to create a "top-level"
system) does additional processing to set the filesystem location of
the top component in that system.  This is detailed
elsewhere, See <a href="Defining-systems-with-defsystem.html#Defining%20systems%20with%20defsystem">Defining systems with defsystem</a>.

<p>The answer to the frequently asked question "how do I create a system
definition where all the source files have a .cl extension" is thus

<br><pre>(defmethod source-file-type ((c cl-source-file) (s (eql (find-system 'my-sys))))
   "cl")
</pre>

<h5>properties</h5>

<p>This attribute is optional.

<p>Packaging systems often require information about files or systems in
addition to that specified by asdf's pre-defined component attributes. 
Programs that create vendor packages out of asdf systems therefore
have to create "placeholder" information to satisfy these systems. 
Sometimes the creator of an asdf system may know the additional
information and wish to provide it directly.

<p>(component-property component property-name) and associated setf
method will allow the programmatic update of this information. 
Property names are compared as if by <code>EQL</code>, so use symbols or
keywords or something.
