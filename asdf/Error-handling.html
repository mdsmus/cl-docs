<h2>Error handling</h2>

<p>It is an error to define a system incorrectly: an implementation may
detect this and signal a generalised instance of
<code>SYSTEM-DEFINITION-ERROR</code>.

<p>Operations may go wrong (for example when source files contain
errors).  These are signalled using generalised instances of
<code>OPERATION-ERROR</code>.
