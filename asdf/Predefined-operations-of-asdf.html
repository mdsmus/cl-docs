<h4>Predefined operations of asdf</h4>

<p>All the operations described in this section are in the <code>asdf</code>
package.  They are invoked via the <code>operate</code> generic function.

<br><pre>(asdf:operate 'asdf:<var>operation-name</var> '<var>system-name</var> {<var>operation-options ...</var>})
</pre>

<p>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td align="left"><b>compile-op</b><i> &amp;key proclamations
</i></td>
<td align="right">Operation</td>
</tr>
</table>
<table width="95%" align="center">
<tr><td>

<p>This operation compiles the specified component.  If proclamations are
supplied, they will be proclaimed.  This is a good place to specify
optimization settings.

<p>When creating a new component type, you should provide methods for
<code>compile-op</code>.

<p>When <code>compile-op</code> is invoked, component dependencies often cause
some parts of the system to be loaded as well as compiled.  Invoking
<code>compile-op</code> does not necessarily load all the parts of the
system, though; use <code>load-op</code> to load a system.

<p>
<table width="100%">

<td align="left"><b>load-op</b><i> &amp;key proclamations
</i></td>
<td align="right">Operation</td>
</tr>
</table>
<table width="95%" align="center">
<tr><td>

<p>This operation loads a system.

<p>The default methods for <code>load-op</code> compile files before loading them. 
For parity, your own methods on new component types should probably do
so too. 
</td></tr>

<table width="100%">

<td align="left"><b>load-source-op</b><i>

<td align="right">Operation</td>

<table width="95%" align="center">
<tr><td>

<p>This operation will load the source for the files in a module even if
the source files have been compiled. Systems sometimes have knotty
dependencies which require that sources are loaded before they can be
compiled.  This is how you do that.

<p>If you are creating a component type, you need to implement this
operation - at least, where meaningful. 
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
<table width="100%">

<td align="left"><b>test-system-version</b><i> &amp;key minimum

<table width="95%" align="center">
<tr><td>

<p>Asks the system whether it satisfies a version requirement.

<p>The default method accepts a string, which is expected to contain of a
number of integers separated by #\. characters.  The method is not
recursive.  The component satisfies the version dependency if it has
the same major number as required and each of its sub-versions is
greater than or equal to the sub-version number required.

<br><pre>(defun version-satisfies (x y)
  (labels ((bigger (x y)
	     (cond ((not y) t)
		   ((not x) nil)
		   ((&gt; (car x) (car y)) t)
		   ((= (car x) (car y))
		    (bigger (cdr x) (cdr y))))))
    (and (= (car x) (car y))
	 (or (not (cdr y)) (bigger (cdr x) (cdr y))))))
</pre>

<p>If that doesn't work for your system, you can override it.  I hope
you have as much fun writing the new method as <pre>#lisp</pre> did
reimplementing this one.

<p>An instance of <code>feature-dependent-op</code> will ignore any components
which have a <code>features</code> attribute, unless the feature combination
it designates is satisfied by <code>*features*</code>.  This operation is
not intended to be instantiated directly, but other operations may
inherit from it.
