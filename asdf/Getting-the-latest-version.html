<h2>Getting the latest version</h2>

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>Decide which version you want.  HEAD is the newest version and
usually OK, whereas RELEASE is for cautious people (e.g. who already
have systems using asdf that they don't want broken), a slightly older
version about which none of the HEAD users have complained.

<li>Check it out from sourceforge cCLan CVS:

<p><kbd>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.cclan.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/cclan login</kbd>

<p>(no password: just press &lt;Enter&gt;)

<p><kbd>cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.cclan.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/cclan co -r RELEASE asdf</kbd>

<p>or for the bleeding edge, instead

<p><kbd>cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.cclan.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/cclan co -A asdf</kbd>

</ol>

<p>If you are tracking the bleeding edge, you may want to subscribe to
the cclan-commits mailing list (see
&lt;<code>http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=28536</code>&gt;) to receive commit
messages and diffs whenever changes are made.
