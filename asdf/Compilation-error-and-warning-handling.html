<h2>Compilation error and warning handling</h2>

<p>ASDF checks for warnings and errors when a file is compiled. The
variables <code>*compile-file-warnings-behaviour*</code> and
<code>*compile-file-errors-behavior*</code> controls the handling of any
such events. The valid values for these variables are <code>:error</code>,
<code>:warn</code>, and <code>:ignore</code>.
