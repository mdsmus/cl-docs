<h3>mk-defsystem (defsystem-3.x)</h3>

<p>We aim to solve basically the same problems as mk-defsystem does. 
However, our architecture for extensibility better exploits CL
language features (and is documented), and we intend to be portable
rather than just widely-ported.  No slight on the mk-defsystem authors
and maintainers is intended here; that implementation has the
unenviable task of supporting non-ANSI implementations, which I
propose to ignore.

<p>The surface defsystem syntax of asdf is more-or-less compatible with
mk-defsystem

<p>The mk-defsystem code for topologically sorting a module's dependency
list was very useful.

<h3>defsystem-4 proposal</h3>

<p>Marco and Peter's proposal for defsystem 4 served as the driver for
many of the features in here.  Notable differences are:

<ul>
<li>We don't specify output files or output file extensions as part of the
system.

<p>If you want to find out what files an operation would create, ask the
operation.

</p><li>We don't deal with CL packages

<p>If you want to compile in a particular package, use an in-package form
in that file (ilisp / SLIME will like you more if you do this anyway)

</p><li>There is no proposal here that defsystem does version control.

<p>A system has a given version which can be used to check dependencies,
but that's all. 
</ul>

<p>The defsystem 4 proposal tends to look more at the external features,
whereas this one centres on a protocol for system introspection.

<h3>kmp's "The Description of Large Systems", MIT AI Memu 801</h3>

<p>Available in updated-for-CL form on the web at
&lt;<code>http://world.std.com/~pitman/Papers/Large-Systems.html</code>&gt;

<p>In our implementation we borrow kmp's overall PROCESS-OPTIONS and
concept to deal with creating component trees from defsystem surface
syntax.  [ this is not true right now, though it used to be and
probably will be again soon ]
