<h4>Creating new component types</h4>

<p>New component types are defined by subclassing one of the existing
component classes and specializing methods on the new component class.

<p><em>FIXME: this should perhaps be explained more throughly, not only by
example ...</em>

<p>As an example, suppose we have some implementation-dependent
functionality that we want to isolate in one subdirectory per Lisp
implementation our system supports.  We create a subclass of
<code>cl-source-file</code>:

<br><pre>(defclass unportable-cl-source-file (cl-source-file)
    ())
</pre>

<p>A hypothetical function <code>system-dependent-dirname</code> gives us the
name of the subdirectory.  All that's left is to define how to
calculate the pathname of an <code>unportable-cl-source-file</code>.

<br><pre>(defmethod component-pathname ((component unportable-cl-source-file))
  (let ((pathname (call-next-method))
        (name (string-downcase (system-dependent-dirname))))
    (merge-pathnames
     (make-pathname :directory (list :relative name))
     pathname)))
</pre>

<p>The new component type is used in a <code>defsystem</code> form in this way:

<br><pre>(defsystem :foo
    :components
    ((:file "packages")
     ...
     (:unportable-cl-source-file "threads"
      :depends-on ("packages" ...))
     ...
    )
</pre>
