<h2 class="appendix">Appendix A Don't Loop, Iterate</h2>

<blockquote>
<b>Note:</b> This appendix is a Texinfo conversion of Jonathan Amsterdam's Working
Paper 324, MIT AI Lab entitled &ldquo;Don't Loop, Iterate.&rdquo;
</blockquote>

<h3 class="section">A.1 Introduction</h3>

<p>Above all the wonders of Lisp's pantheon stand its metalinguistic
tools; by their grace have Lisp's acolytes been liberated from the
rigid asceticism of lesser faiths.  Thanks to Macro and kin, the
jolly, complacent Lisp hacker can gaze through a fragrant cloud of
setfs and defstructs at the emaciated unfortunates below, scraping out
their meager code in inflexible notation, and sneer superciliously. 
It's a good feeling.

   <p>But all's not joy in Consville.  For&mdash;I beg your pardon, but&mdash;there
really is no good way to <em>iterate</em> in Lisp.  Now, some are happy
to map their way about, whether for real with <code>mapcar</code> and
friends, or with the make-believe of Series; others are so satisfied
with <code>do</code> it's a wonder they're not C hackers.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>  Still others have gotten by with <code>loop</code>, but are
getting tired of looking up the syntax in the manual over and over
again.  And in the elegant schemes of some, only tail recursion and
lambdas figure.  But that still leaves a sizeable majority of
folk&mdash;well, me, at least&mdash;who would simply like to <em>iterate</em>,
thank you, but in a way that provides nice abstractions, is
extensible, and looks like honest-to-God Lisp.

   <p>In what follows I describe a macro package, called <code>iterate</code>, that
provides the power and convenient abstractions of <code>loop</code> but in a
more syntactically palatable way.  <code>iter</code> also has many features
that <code>loop</code> lacks, like generators and better support for nested
loops.  <code>iterate</code> generates inline code, so it's more efficient than
using the higher-order function approach.  And <code>iterate</code> is also
extensible&mdash;it's easy to add new clauses to its vocabulary in order
to express new patterns of iteration in a convenient way.

<!-- \iter\ is fully documented in AI Lab Memo No. 1236, \iman. -->
<h3 class="section">A.2 More about <code>iterate</code></h3>

<p>A Common Lisp programmer who wonders what's lacking with present-day
iteration features would do well to consider <code>setf</code>.  Of course,
<code>setf</code> doesn't iterate, but it has some other nice properties. 
It's easy to use, for one thing.  It's extensible&mdash;you can define new
<code>setf</code> methods very easily, so that <code>setf</code> will work with
new forms.  <code>setf</code> is also efficient, turning into code that's as
good as anyone could write by hand.  Arguably, <code>setf</code> provides a
nice abstraction: it allows you to view value-returning forms, like
<code>(car ...)</code> or <code>(get ...)</code> as locations that can be
stored into.  Finally and most obviously, <code>setf</code> <em>looks</em>
like Lisp; it's got a syntax right out of <code>setq</code>.

   <p><code>iterate</code> attempts to provide all of these properties.  Here is a simple
use of <code>iterate</code> that returns all the elements of <code>num-list</code> that
are greater than three:

<pre class="lisp">  (iterate (for el in num-list)
           (when (&gt; el 3)
             (collect el)))
</pre>
   <p>An <code>iterate</code> form consists of the symbol <code>iterate</code> followed by some Lisp
forms.  Any legal Lisp form is allowed, as well as certain forms that
<code>iterate</code> treats specially, called <em>clauses</em>.  <code>for...in</code>
and <code>collect</code> are the two clauses in the above example.  An
<code>iterate</code> clause can appear anywhere a Lisp form can appear; <code>iterate</code>
walks its body, looking inside every form, processing <code>iterate</code> clauses
when it finds them.  It even expands macros, so you can write macros
that contain <code>iterate</code> clauses.  Almost all clauses use the syntax of
function keyword-argument lists: alternating keywords and arguments. 
<code>iterate</code> keywords don't require a preceding colon, but you can use one
if you like.

   <p><code>iterate</code> provides many convenient iteration abstractions, most of them
familiar to <code>loop</code> users.  Iteration-driving clauses (those
beginning with <code>for</code>) can iterate over numbers, lists, arrays,
hashtables, packages and files.  There are clauses for collecting
values into a list, summing and counting, maximizing, finding maximal
elements, and various other things.  Here are a few examples, for
extra flavor.

   <p>To sum a list of numbers:

<pre class="lisp">  (iterate (for i in list)
           (sum i))
</pre>
   <p>To find the length of the shortest element in a list:

<pre class="lisp">  (iterate (for el in list)
           (minimize (length el)))
</pre>
   <p>To find the shortest element in a list:

<pre class="lisp">  (iterate (for el in list)
           (finding el minimizing (length el)))
</pre>
   <p>To return <code>t</code> only if every other element of a list is odd:

<pre class="lisp">  (iterate (for els on list by #'cddr)
           (always (oddp (car els))))
</pre>
   <p>To split an association list into two separate lists (this example
uses <code>iterate</code>'s ability to do destructuring):

<pre class="lisp">  (iterate (for (key . item) in alist)
           (collect key into keys)
           (collect item into items)
           (finally (return (values keys items))))
</pre>
   <h3 class="section">A.3 Comparisons With Other Iteration Methods</h3>

<p>As with any aspect of coding, how to iterate is a matter of taste.  I
do not wish to dictate taste or even to suggest that <code>iterate</code> is a
&ldquo;better&rdquo; way to iterate than other methods.  I would, however, like
to examine the options, and explain why I prefer <code>iterate</code> to its
competitors.

<h4 class="subsection">A.3.1 <code>do</code>, <code>dotimes</code> and <code>dolist</code></h4>

<p>The <code>do</code> form has long been a Lisp iteration staple.  It provides
for binding of iteration variables, an end-test, and a body of
arbitrary code.  It can be a bit cumbersome for simple applications,
but the most common special cases&mdash;iterating over the integers from
zero and over the members of a list&mdash;appear more conveniently as
<code>dotimes</code> and <code>dolist</code>.

   <p><code>do</code>'s major problem is that it provides no abstraction.  For
example, collection is typically handled by binding a variable to
<code>nil</code>, pushing elements onto the variable, and <code>nreverse</code>ing
the result before returning it.  Such a common iteration pattern
should be easier to write.  (It is, using <code>mapcar</code>&mdash;but see
below.)

   <p>Another problem with <code>do</code>, for me at least, is that it's hard to
read.  The crucial end-test is buried between the bindings and the
body, marked off only by an extra set of parens (and some
indentation).  It is also unclear, until after a moment of
recollection, whether the end-test has the sense of a &ldquo;while&rdquo; or an
&ldquo;until.&rdquo;

   <p>Despite its flaws, <code>do</code> is superior to the iteration facilities
of every other major programming language except CLU.  Perhaps that is
the reason many Lisp programmers don't mind using it.

<h4 class="subsection">A.3.2 Tail Recursion</h4>

<!-- FIXME: removed citation due to laziness -->
<p>Tail-recursive implementations of loops, like those found in Scheme
code [SchemeBook], are parsimonious and illuminating.  They have the
advantage of looking like recursion, hence unifying the notation for
two different types of processes.  For example, if only tail-recursion
is used, a loop that operates on list elements from front to back
looks very much like a recursion that operates on them from back to
front.

   <p>However, using tail-recursion exclusively can lead to cumbersome code
and a proliferation of functions, especially when one would like to
embed a loop inside a function.  Tail-recursion also provides no
abstraction for iteration; in Scheme, that is typically done with
higher-order functions.

<h4 class="subsection">A.3.3 High-order Dunctions</h4>

<p>Lisp's age-old mapping functions, recently revamped for Common Lisp
[CLM], are another favorite for iteration.  They provide a pleasing
abstraction, and it's easy to write new higher-order functions to
express common iteration patterns.  Common Lisp already comes with
many such useful functions, for removing, searching, and performing
reductions on lists.  Another Common Lisp advantage is that these
functions work on any sequence&mdash;vectors as well as lists.

   <p>One problem with higher-order functions is that they are inefficient,
requiring multiple calls on their argument function.  While the the
built-ins, like <code>map</code> and <code>mapcar</code>, can be open-coded, that
cannot be so easily done for user-written functions.  Also, using
higher-order functions often results in the creation of intermediate
sequences that could be avoided if the iteration were written out
explicitly.

   <p>The second problem with higher-order functions is very much a matter
of personal taste.  While higher-order functions are theoretically
elegant, they are often cumbersome to read and write.  The unpleasant
sharp-quote required by Common Lisp is particularly annoying here, and
even in Scheme, I find the presence of a lambda with its argument list
visually distracting.

   <p>Another problem is that it's difficult to express iteration of
sequences of integers without creating such sequences explicitly as
lists or arrays.  One could resort to tail-recursion or
<code>dotimes</code>&mdash;but then it becomes very messy to express double
iterations where one driver is over integers.  Multiple iteration is
easy in <code>iterate</code>, as illustrated by the following example, which creates
an alist of list elements and their positions:

<pre class="lisp">  (iterate (for el in list)
           (for i from 0)
           (collect (cons el i)))
</pre>
   <h4 class="subsection">A.3.4 Streams and Generators</h4>

<p>For really heavy-duty iteration jobs, nothing less than a
coroutine-like mechanism will do.  Such mechanisms hide the state of
the iteration behind a convenient abstraction.  A <em>generator</em> is
a procedure that returns the next element in the iteration each time
it is called.  A <em>stream</em> (in the terminology of [SchemeBook]) is
a data structure which represents the iteration, but which computes
the next element only on demand.  Generators and streams support a
similar style of programming.  Here, for example, is how you might
enumerate the leaves of a tree (represented as a Lisp list with atoms
at the leaves) using streams:

<pre class="lisp">  (defun tree-leaves (tree)
    (if (atom tree)
        (stream-cons tree empty-stream)
        (stream-append (tree-leaves (car tree))
                       (tree-leaves (cdr tree)))))
</pre>
   <p>Although <code>tree-leaves</code> looks like an ordinary recursion, it will
only do enough work to find the first leaf before returning.  The
stream it returns can be accessed with <code>stream-car</code>, which will
yield the (already computed) first leaf of the tree, or with
<code>stream-cdr</code>, which will initiate computation of the next leaf.

   <p>Such a computation would be cumbersome to write using <code>iterate</code>, or any
of the other standard iteration constructs; in fact, it is not even
technically speaking an iteration, if we confine that term to
processes that take constant space and linear time.  Streams, then,
are definitely more powerful than standard iteration machinery.

   <p>Unfortunately, streams are very expensive, since they must somehow
save the state of the computation.  Generators are typically cheaper,
but are less powerful and still require at least a function call.  So
these powerful tools should be used only when necessary, and that is
not very often; most of the time, ordinary iteration suffices.

   <p>There is one aspect of generators that <code>iterate</code> can capture, and that
is the ability to produce elements on demand.  Say we wish to create
an alist that pairs the non-null elements of a list with the positive
integers.  We saw above that it is easy to iterate over a list and a
series of numbers simultaneously, but here we would like to do
something a little different: we want to iterate over the list of
elements, but only draw a number when we need one (namely, when a list
element is non-null). The solution employs the <code>iterate</code> <code>generate</code>
keyword in place of <code>for</code> and the special clause <code>next</code>:

<pre class="lisp">  (iterate (for el in list)
           (generate i from 1)
           (if el
               (collect (cons el (next i)))))
</pre>
   <p>Using <code>next</code> with any driver variable changes how that driver
works.  Instead of supplying its values one at a time on each
iteration, the driver computes a value only when a <code>next</code> clause
is executed.  This ability to obtain values on demand greatly
increases <code>iterate</code>'s power.  Here, <code>el</code> is set to the next element
of the list on each iteration, as usual; but <code>i</code> is set only when
<code>(next i)</code> is executed.

<h4 class="subsection">A.3.5 Series</h4>

<p>Richard C. Waters has developed a very elegant notation called Series
which allows iteration to be expressed as sequence-mapping somewhat in
the style of APL, but which compiles to efficient looping code
[Series].

   <p>My reasons for not using Series are, again, matters of taste.  Like
many elegant notations, Series can be somewhat cryptic.  Understanding
what a Series expression does can require some effort until one has
mastered the idiom.  And if you wish to share your code with others,
they will have to learn Series as well.  <code>iterate</code> suffers from this
problem to some extent, but since the iteration metaphor it proposes
is much more familiar to most programmers than that of Series, it is
considerably easier to learn and read.

<h4 class="subsection">A.3.6 <code>Prog</code> and <code>Go</code></h4>

<p>Oh, don't be silly.

<h4 class="subsection">A.3.7 <code>Loop</code></h4>

<p><code>loop</code> is the iteration construct most similar to <code>iterate</code> in
appearance.  <code>loop</code> is a macro written originally for MacLisp and
in widespread use [Loop].  It has been adopted as part of Common Lisp. 
<code>loop</code> provides high-level iteration with abstractions for
collecting, summing, maximizing and so on.  Recall our first <code>iterate</code>
example:

<pre class="lisp">  (iterate (for el in num-list)
           (when (&gt; el 3)
             (collect el)))
</pre>
   <p>Expressed with \looP, it would read

<pre class="lisp">  (loop for el in list
        when (&gt; el 3)
          collect el)
</pre>
   <p>The similarity between the two macros should immediately be apparent. 
Most of <code>iterate</code>'s clauses were borrowed from <code>loop</code>.  But
compared to <code>iterate</code>, <code>loop</code> has a paucity of parens.  Though
touted as more readable than heavily-parenthesized code, <code>loop</code>'s
Pascalish syntax creates several problems.  First, many
dyed-in-the-wool Lisp hackers simply find it ugly.  Second, it
requires learning the syntax of a whole new sublanguage.  Third, the
absence of parens makes it hard to parse, both by machine and, more
importantly, by human.  Fourth, one often has to consult the manual to
recall lesser-used aspects of the strange syntax.  Fifth, there is no
good interface with the rest of Lisp, so <code>loop</code> clauses cannot
appear inside Lisp forms and macros cannot expand to pieces of
<code>loop</code>.  And Sixth, pretty-printers and indenters that don't know
about <code>loop</code> will invariably display it wrongly.  This is
particularly a problem with program-editor indenters.  A reasonably
clever indenter, like that of Gnu Emacs, can indent nearly any normal
Lisp form correctly, and can be easily customized for most new forms. 
But it can't at present handle <code>loop</code>.  The syntax of <code>iterate</code> was
designed to keep parens to a minimum, but conform close enough to Lisp
so as not to confuse code-display tools.  Gnu Emacs indents <code>iterate</code>
reasonably with no modifications.

   <p>Indenting is a mere annoyance; <code>loop</code>'s lack of extensibility is
a more serious problem.  The original <code>loop</code> was completely
extensible, but the Symbolics version only provides for the definition
of new iteration-driving clauses, and the Common Lisp specification
does not have any extension mechanism.  But extensibility is a boon. 
Consider first the problem of adding the elements of a list together,
which can be accomplished with <code>iterate</code> by

<pre class="lisp">  (iterate (for el in list)
           (sum el))
</pre>
   <p>and in <code>loop</code> with

<pre class="lisp">  (loop for el in list
        sum el)
</pre>
   <p>But now, say that you wished to compute the sum of the square roots of
the elements.  You could of course write, in either <code>loop</code> or
<code>iterate</code>,

<pre class="lisp">  (iterate (for el in list)
           (sum (sqrt el)))
</pre>
   <p>But perhaps you find yourself writing such loops often enough to make
it worthwhile to create a new abstraction.  There is nothing you can
do in <code>loop</code>, but in <code>iterate</code> you could simply write a macro:

<pre class="lisp">  (defmacro (sum-of-sqrts expr &amp;optional into-var)
    `(sum (sqrt ,expr) into ,into-var))
</pre>
   <p><code>sum-of-sqrts</code> is a perfectly ordinary Lisp macro. Since <code>iterate</code>
expands all macros and processes the results, <code>(sum-of-sqrts el)</code>
will behave exactly as if we'd written <code>(sum (sqrt el))</code>.

   <p>There's also a way to define macros that use <code>iterate</code>'s clause syntax.

<!-- Just to beat a dead horse, I'd like to point out that there's no -->
<!-- way to define {\lisp for...maximizing} in \looP.\footnote{In fact, -->
<!-- it was in part the frustration of knowing that \looP\ could -->
<!-- generate code to maximize a value, but could not be easily altered -->
<!-- to supply the element associated with that maximum, that prompted -->
<!-- me to write \iter.} -->
<h3 class="section">A.4 Implementation</h3>

<p>A Common Lisp implementation of <code>iterate</code> has existed for well over a
year.  It runs under Lucid for HP 300's, Sun 3's and SPARCstations,
and on Symbolics Lisp machines. 
<!-- See \iman\ for details. -->

<h3 class="section">A.5 Conclusion</h3>

<p>Iteration is a matter of taste.  I find <code>iterate</code> more palatable than
other iteration constructs: it's more readable, more efficient than
most, provides nice abstractions, and can be extended.

   <p>If you're new to Lisp iteration, start with <code>iterate</code>&mdash;look before you
<code>loop</code>.  If you're already using <code>loop</code> and like the power
that it offers, but have had enough of its syntax and inflexibility,
then my advice to you is, don't <code>looo</code>&mdash;<code>iterate</code>.

<h3 class="section">A.6 Acknowledgments</h3>

<p>Thanks to David Clemens for many helpful suggestions and for the
egregious pun near the end.  Conversations with Richard Waters
prompted me to add many improvements to <code>iterate</code>.  Alan Bawden, Sundar
Narasimhan, and Jerry Roylance also provided useful comments.  David
Clemens and Oren Etzioni shared with me the joys of beta-testing.
