CMUCL is a free, high-performance implementation of the Common Lisp
programming language which runs on most major Unix platforms. It
mainly conforms to the ANSI Common Lisp standard. Here is a summary
of its main features:
<ul>
<li>a <em>sophisticated native-code compiler</em> which is capable
of powerful type inferences, and generates code competitive in
speed with C compilers.<br>
<br></li>
<li>generational garbage collection and multiprocessing capability
on the x86 ports.<br>
<br></li>
<li>a foreign function interface which allows interfacing with C
code and system libraries, including shared libraries on most
platforms, and direct access to Unix system calls.<br>
<br></li>
<li>support for interprocess communication and remote procedure
calls.<br>
<br></li>
<li>an implementation of CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System, which
includes multimethods and a metaobject protocol.<br>
<br></li>
<li>a graphical source-level debugger using a Motif interface, and
a code profiler.<br>
<br></li>
<li>an interface to the X11 Window System (CLX), and a
sophisticated graphical widget library (Garnet).<br>
<br></li>
<li>programmer-extensible input and output streams.<br>
<br></li>
<li>an Emacs-like editor implemented in Common Lisp.<br>
<br></li>
<li>public domain: free, with full source code and no strings
attached (and no warranty). Like GNU/Linux and the *BSD operating
systems, CMUCL is maintained and improved by a team of volunteers
collaborating over the Internet.</li>
</ul>
This user's manual contains only implementation-specific
information about CMUCL. Users will also need a separate manual
describing the Common Lisp standard, for example, the
<em>Hyperspec</em> at <a href=
"http://www.xanalys.com/software_tools">www.xanalys.com</a><br>
<br>
In addition to the language itself, this document describes a
number of useful library modules that run in CMUCL. Hemlock, an
Emacs-like text editor, is included as an integral part of the
CMUCL environment. Two documents describe Hemlock: the <i>Hemlock
User's Manual</i>, and the <i>Hemlock Command Implementor's
Manual</i>.<br>

The command line syntax and environment is described in the
<code>lisp(1)</code> man page in the man/man1 directory of the
distribution. See also <code>cmucl(1)</code>. Currently CMUCL
accepts the following switches:<br>
<br>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><tt class="code">-batch</tt><br></dt>
<dd>specifies batch mode, where all input is directed from
standard-input. An error code of 0 is returned upon encountering an
EOF and 1 otherwise.<br>
<br></dd>
<dt><tt class="code">-quiet</tt><br></dt>
<dd>enters quiet mode. This implies setting the variables
<tt class="code">*load-verbose*</tt>, <tt class=
"code">*compile-verbose*</tt>, <tt class=
"code">*compile-print*</tt>, <tt class=
"code">*compile-progress*</tt>, <tt class=
"code">*require-verbose*</tt> and <tt class=
"code">*gc-verbose*</tt> to NIL, and disables the printing of the
startup banner.<br>
<br></dd>
<dt><tt class="code">-core</tt><br></dt>
<dd>requires an argument that should be the name of a core file.
Rather than using the default core file, which is searched in a
number of places, according to the initial value of the <tt class=
"code">library:</tt> search-list, the specified core file is
loaded. This switch overrides the value of the <tt class=
"code">CMUCLCORE</tt> environment variable, if present.<br>
<br></dd>
<dt><tt class="code">-lib</tt><br></dt>
<dd>requires an argument that should be the path to the CMUCL
library directory, which is going to be used to initialize the
<tt class="code">library:</tt> search-list, among other things.
This switch overrides the value of the <tt class=
"code">CMUCLLIB</tt> environment variable, if present.<br>
<br></dd>
<dt><tt class="code">-dynamic-space-size</tt><br></dt>
<dd>requires an argument that should be the number of megabytes
(1048576 bytes) that should be allocated to the heap. If not
specified, a platform-specific default is used. The actual maximum
allowed heap size is platform-specific.<br>
<br>
Currently, this option is only available for the x86 and sparc
platforms.<br>
<br></dd>
<dt><tt class="code">-edit</tt><br></dt>
<dd>specifies to enter Hemlock. A file to edit may be specified by
placing the name of the file between the program name (usually
<tt class="filename">lisp</tt>) and the first switch.<br>
<br></dd>
<dt><tt class="code">-eval</tt><br></dt>
<dd>accepts one argument which should be a Lisp form to evaluate
during the start up sequence. The value of the form will not be
printed unless it is wrapped in a form that does output.<br>
<br></dd>
<dt><tt class="code">-hinit</tt><br></dt>
<dd>accepts an argument that should be the name of the hemlock init
file to load the first time the function <a name=
"@funs0"></a><tt class="code">ed</tt> is invoked. The default is to
load <tt class="filename">hemlock-init.<tt class=
"variable">object-type</tt></tt>, or if that does not exist,
<tt class="filename">hemlock-init.lisp</tt> from the user's home
directory. If the file is not in the user's home directory, the
full path must be specified.<br>
<br></dd>
<dt><tt class="code">-init</tt><br></dt>
<dd>accepts an argument that should be the name of an init file to
load during the normal start up sequence. The default is to load
<tt class="filename">init.<tt class=
"variable">object-type</tt></tt> or, if that does not exist,
<tt class="filename">init.lisp</tt> from the user's home directory.
If the file is not in the user's home directory, the full path must
be specified.<br>
<br></dd>
<dt><tt class="code">-noinit</tt><br></dt>
<dd>accepts no arguments and specifies that an init file should not
be loaded during the normal start up sequence. Also, this switch
suppresses the loading of a hemlock init file when Hemlock is
started up with the <tt class="code">-edit</tt> switch.<br>
<br></dd>
<dt><tt class="code">-nositeinit</tt><br></dt>
<dd>accepts no arguments and specifies that the site init file
should not be loaded during the normal start up sequence.<br>
<br></dd>
<dt><tt class="code">-load</tt><br></dt>
<dd>accepts an argument which should be the name of a file to load
into Lisp before entering Lisp's read-eval-print loop.<br>
<br></dd>
<dt><tt class="code">-slave</tt><br></dt>
<dd>specifies that Lisp should start up as a islave Lisp and try to
connect to an editor Lisp. The name of the editor to connect to
must be specified---to find the editor's name, use the Hemlock
``<tt class="code">Accept Slave Connections</tt>'' command. The
name for the editor Lisp is of the form:
<blockquote class="example">
<pre>
    <tt class="variable">machine-name</tt><tt class=
"code">:</tt><tt class="variable">socket</tt>
  
</pre></blockquote>
where <tt class="variable">machine-name</tt> is the internet host
name for the machine and <tt class="variable">socket</tt> is the
decimal number of the socket to connect to.</dd>
</dl>
For more details on the use of the <tt class="code">-edit</tt> and
<tt class="code">-slave</tt> switches, see the <i>Hemlock User's
Manual</i>.<br>
<br>
Arguments to the above switches can be specified in one of two
ways: <tt class="variable">switch</tt><tt class=
"code">=</tt><tt class="variable">value</tt> or <tt class=
"variable">switch</tt>&lt;<tt class=
"variable">space</tt>&gt;<tt class="variable">value</tt>. For
example, to start up the saved core file mylisp.core use either of
the following two commands:
<blockquote class="example">
<pre>
   lisp -core=mylisp.core
   lisp -core mylisp.core
</pre></blockquote>

CMUCL was developed at the Computer Science Department of Carnegie
Mellon University. The work was a small autonomous part within the
Mach microkernel-based operating system project, and started more
as a tool development effort than a research project. The project
started out as Spice Lisp, which provided a modern Lisp
implementation for use in the CMU community. CMUCL has been under
continual development since the early 1980's (concurrent with the
Common Lisp standardization effort). Most of the CMU Common Lisp
implementors went on to work on the Gwydion environment for Dylan.
The CMU team was lead by Scott E. Fahlman, the Python compiler was
written by Robert MacLachlan.<br>
<br>
CMUCL's CLOS implementation is derived from the PCL reference
implementation written at Xerox PARC:

Its implementation of the LOOP macro was derived from code from
Symbolics, which was derived from code written at MIT:

CMUCL was funded by DARPA under CMU's "Research on Parallel
Computing" contract. Rather than doing pure research on programming
languages and environments, the emphasis was on developing
practical programming tools. Sometimes this required new
technology, but much of the work was in creating a Common Lisp
environment that incorporates state-of-the-art features from
existing systems (both Lisp and non-Lisp). Archives of the project
are available online.<br>
<br>
The project funding stopped in 1994, so support at Carnegie Mellon
University has been discontinued. All code and documentation
developed at CMU was released into the public domain. The project
continues as a group of users and developers collaborating over the
Internet. The currently active maintainers are:
<ul>
<li>Marco Antoniotti</li>
<li>Martin Cracauer</li>
<li>Rob MacLachlan</li>
<li>Pierre Mai</li>
<li>Eric Marsden</li>
<li>Gerd Moellman</li>
<li>Tim Moore</li>
<li>Raymond Toy</li>
<li>Peter Van Eynde</li>
<li>Paul Werkowski</li>
</ul>
In particular, Paul Werkowski and Douglas Crosher completed the
port for the x86 architecture for FreeBSD. Peter VanEnyde took the
FreeBSD port and created a Linux version. Other people who have
contributed to the development of CMUCL since 1981 are
