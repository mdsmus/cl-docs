<h4 class="subsection">1.6.3 Common Lisp Books</h4>

<p>If you're not a programmer and you're trying to learn, many
introductory Lisp books are available. However, we don't have any
standout favorites. If you can't decide, try checking the Usenet
<a href="news://comp.lang.lisp">news://comp.lang.lisp</a> FAQ for recent recommendations.

<!-- FIXME: This non-stance is silly. Maybe we could recommend SICP, -->
<!-- Touretzky, or something at least. -->
   <p>If you are an experienced programmer in other languages but need to
learn about Common Lisp, some books stand out:

     <dl>
<!-- FIXME: Ask Seibel if he minds us referring to the preview -->
<!-- @item Practical Common Lisp, by Peter Seibel -->
<!-- A forthcoming book from APress with a web free preview at -->
<!-- @uref{http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/}. An excellent introduction to -->
<!-- the language, covering both the basics and ``advanced topics'' like -->
<!-- macros, CLOS, and packages. -->

     <dt><cite>ANSI Common Lisp, by Paul Graham</cite><dd>Introduces most of the language, though some parts (eg. CLOS) are
covered only lightly.

     <br><dt><cite>On Lisp, by Paul Graham</cite><dd>An in-depth treatment of macros, but not recommended as a first Common
Lisp book, since it is slightly pre-ANSI so you need to be on your
guard against non-standard usages, and since it doesn't really even
try to cover the language as a whole, focusing solely on macros. 
Downloadable from <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html">http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html</a>.

     <br><dt><cite>Paradigms Of Artificial Intelligence Programming, by Peter Norvig</cite><dd>Good information on general Common Lisp programming, and many
nontrivial examples. Whether or not your work is AI, it's a very good
book to look at.

     <br><dt><cite>Object-Oriented Programming In Common Lisp, by Sonya Keene</cite><dd><!-- With the exception of @cite{Practical Common Lisp} -->
None the books above emphasize CLOS, but this one does. Even if you're
very knowledgeable about object oriented programming in the abstract,
it's worth looking at this book if you want to do any OO in Common
Lisp. Some abstractions in CLOS (especially multiple dispatch) go
beyond anything you'll see in most OO systems, and there are a number
of lesser differences as well. This book tends to help with the
culture shock.

     <br><dt><cite>Art Of Metaobject Programming, by Gregor Kiczales et al.</cite><dd>Currently to prime source of information on the Common Lisp Metaobject
Protocol, which is supported by SBCL. Section 2 (Chapers 5 and 6) are
freely available at <a href="http://www.lisp.org/mop/">http://www.lisp.org/mop/</a>.
