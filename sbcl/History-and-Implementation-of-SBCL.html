<h3 class="section">1.7 History and Implementation of SBCL</h3>

<p>You can work productively with SBCL without knowing or
understanding anything about where it came from, how it is
implemented, or how it extends the ANSI Common Lisp standard. However,
a little knowledge can be helpful in order to understand error
messages, to troubleshoot problems, to understand why some parts of
the system are better debugged than others, and to anticipate which
known bugs, known performance problems, and missing extensions are
likely to be fixed, tuned, or added.

   <p>SBCL is descended from CMUCL, which is itself descended from Spice
Lisp, including early implementations for the Mach operating system on
the IBM RT, back in the 1980s. Some design decisions from that time are
still reflected in the current implementation:

     <ul>
<li>The system expects to be loaded into a fixed-at-compile-time location
in virtual memory, and also expects the location of all of its heap
storage to be specified at compile time.

     <li>The system overcommits memory, allocating large amounts of address
space from the system (often more than the amount of virtual memory
available) and then failing if ends up using too much of the allocated
storage.

     <li>The system is implemented as a C program which is responsible for
supplying low-level services and loading a Lisp <samp><span class="file">.core</span></samp>
file.

   </ul>

   <p><a name="index-Garbage-Collection_002c-generational-2"></a>SBCL also inherited some newer architectural features from CMUCL. The
most important is that on some architectures it has a generational
garbage collector (&ldquo;GC&rdquo;), which has various implications (mostly
good) for performance. These are discussed in another chapter,
<a href="Efficiency.html#Efficiency">Efficiency</a>.

   <p>SBCL has diverged from CMUCL in that SBCL is now essentially a
&ldquo;compiler-only implementation&rdquo; of Common Lisp. This is a change in
implementation strategy, taking advantage of the freedom &ldquo;any of these
facilities might share the same execution strategy&rdquo; guaranteed in the
ANSI specification section 3.1 (&ldquo;Evaluation&rdquo;). It does not mean SBCL
can't be used interactively, and in fact the change is largely invisible
to the casual user, since SBCL still can and does execute code
interactively by compiling it on the fly. (It is visible if you know how
to look, like using <code>compiled-function-p</code>; and it is visible in the
way that SBCL doesn't have many bugs which behave differently in
interpreted code than in compiled code.) What it means is that in SBCL,
the <code>eval</code> function only truly &ldquo;interprets&rdquo; a few easy kinds of
forms, such as symbols which are <code>boundp</code>. More complicated forms
are evaluated by calling <code>compile</code> and then calling <code>funcall</code>
on the returned result.

   <p>The direct ancestor of SBCL is the x86 port of CMUCL. This port was in
some ways the most cobbled-together of all the CMUCL ports, since a
number of strange changes had to be made to support the register-poor
x86 architecture. Some things (like tracing and debugging) do not work
particularly well there. SBCL should be able to improve in these areas
(and has already improved in some other areas), but it takes a while.

   <p><a name="index-Garbage-Collection_002c-conservative-3"></a>On the x86 SBCL &ndash; like the x86 port of CMUCL &ndash; uses a
<em>conservative</em> GC. This means that it doesn't maintain a strict
separation between tagged and untagged data, instead treating some
untagged data (e.g. raw floating point numbers) as possibly-tagged
data and so not collecting any Lisp objects that they point to. This
has some negative consequences for average time efficiency (though
possibly no worse than the negative consequences of trying to
implement an exact GC on a processor architecture as register-poor as
the X86) and also has potentially unlimited consequences for
worst-case memory efficiency. In practice, conservative garbage
collectors work reasonably well, not getting anywhere near the worst
case. But they can occasionally cause odd patterns of memory usage.

   <p>The fork from CMUCL was based on a major rewrite of the system
bootstrap process. CMUCL has for many years tolerated a very unusual
&ldquo;build&rdquo; procedure which doesn't actually build the complete system
from scratch, but instead progressively overwrites parts of a running
system with new versions. This quasi-build procedure can cause various
bizarre bootstrapping hangups, especially when a major change is made
to the system. It also makes the connection between the current source
code and the current executable more tenuous than in other software
systems &ndash; it's easy to accidentally &ldquo;build&rdquo; a CMUCL system
containing characteristics not reflected in the current version of the
source code.

   <p>Other major changes since the fork from CMUCL include

     <ul>
<li>SBCL has removed many CMUCL extensions, (e.g. IP networking,
remote procedure call, Unix system interface, and X11 interface) from
the core system. Most of these are available as contributed modules
(distributed with sbcl) or third-party modules instead.

     <li>SBCL has deleted or deprecated some nonstandard features and code
complexity which helped efficiency at the price of
maintainability. For example, the SBCL compiler no longer implements
memory pooling internally (and so is simpler and more maintainable,
but generates more garbage and runs more slowly), and various
block-compilation efficiency-increasing extensions to the language
have been deleted or are no longer used in the implementation of SBCL
itself.

   </ul>
