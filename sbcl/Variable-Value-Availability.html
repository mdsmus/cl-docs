<h4 class="subsection">4.4.1 Variable Value Availability</h4>

<p><a name="index-Availability-of-debug-variables-87"></a><a name="index-Validity-of-debug-variables-88"></a><a name="index-Debug-optimization-quality-89"></a>
The value of a variable may be unavailable to the debugger in portions
of the program where Lisp says that the variable is defined.  If a
variable value is not available, the debugger will not let you read or
write that variable.  With one exception, the debugger will never
display an incorrect value for a variable.  Rather than displaying
incorrect values, the debugger tells you the value is unavailable.

   <p>The one exception is this: if you interrupt (e.g., with &lt;C-c&gt;) or
if there is an unexpected hardware error such as &ldquo;&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bus error</span></samp>&rsquo;&rdquo;
(which should only happen in unsafe code), then the values displayed
for arguments to the interrupted frame might be
incorrect.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>  This exception applies only to the
interrupted frame: any frame farther down the stack will be fine.

   <p>The value of a variable may be unavailable for these reasons:

     <ul>
<li>The value of the <code>debug</code> optimization quality may have omitted debug
information needed to determine whether the variable is available. 
Unless a variable is an argument, its value will only be available when
<code>debug</code> is at least <code>2</code>.

     <li>The compiler did lifetime analysis and determined that the value was no longer
needed, even though its scope had not been exited.  Lifetime analysis is
inhibited when the <code>debug</code> optimization quality is <code>3</code>.

     <li>The variable's name is an uninterned symbol (gensym).  To save space, the
compiler only dumps debug information about uninterned variables when the
<code>debug</code> optimization quality is <code>3</code>.

     <li>The frame's location is unknown (see <a href="Unknown-Locations-and-Interrupts.html#Unknown-Locations-and-Interrupts">Unknown Locations and Interrupts</a>) because the debugger was entered due to an interrupt or
unexpected hardware error.  Under these conditions the values of
arguments will be available, but might be incorrect.  This is the
exception mentioned above.

     <li>The variable (or the code referencing it) was optimized out
of existence.  Variables with no reads are always optimized away.  The
degree to which the compiler deletes variables will depend on the
value of the <code>compilation-speed</code> optimization quality, but most
source-level optimizations are done under all compilation policies.

     <li>The variable is never set and its definition looks like
     <pre class="lisp">          (LET ((var1 var2))
             ...)
</pre>
     <p>In this case, <code>var1</code> is substituted with <code>var2</code>.

     <li>The variable is never set and is referenced exactly once.  In this
case, the reference is substituted with the variable initial value.

   </ul>

   <p>Since it is especially useful to be able to get the arguments to a
function, argument variables are treated specially when the
<code>speed</code> optimization quality is less than <code>3</code> and the
<code>debug</code> quality is at least <code>1</code>.  With this compilation
policy, the values of argument variables are almost always available
everywhere in the function, even at unknown locations.  For
non-argument variables, <code>debug</code> must be at least <code>2</code> for
values to be available, and even then, values are only available at
known locations.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> Since the location of an interrupt or hardware
error will always be an unknown location, non-argument variable values
will never be available in the interrupted frame.  See <a href="Unknown-Locations-and-Interrupts.html#Unknown-Locations-and-Interrupts">Unknown Locations and Interrupts</a>.</p>
