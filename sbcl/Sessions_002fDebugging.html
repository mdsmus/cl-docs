<h3 class="section">11.6 Sessions/Debugging</h3>

<p>If the user has multiple views onto the same Lisp image (for example,
using multiple terminals, or a windowing system, or network access)
they are typically set up as multiple <dfn>sessions</dfn> such that each
view has its own collection of foreground/background/stopped threads. 
A thread which wishes to create a new session can use
<code>sb-thread:with-new-session</code> to remove itself from the current
session (which it shares with its parent and siblings) and create a
fresh one. 
# See also <code>sb-thread:make-listener-thread</code>.

   <p>Within a single session, threads arbitrate between themselves for the
user's attention.  A thread may be in one of three notional states:
foreground, background, or stopped.  When a background process
attempts to print a repl prompt or to enter the debugger, it will stop
and print a message saying that it has stopped.  The user at his
leisure may switch to that thread to find out what it needs.  If a
background thread enters the debugger, selecting any restart will put
it back into the background before it resumes.  Arbitration for the
input stream is managed by calls to <code>sb-thread:get-foreground</code>
(which may block) and <code>sb-thread:release-foreground</code>.

   <p><code>sb-ext:quit</code> terminates all threads in the current session, but
leaves other sessions running.
