<h3 class="section">8.1 Lisp Pathnames</h3>

<p>There are many aspects of ANSI Common Lisp's pathname support which are
implementation-defined and so need documentation.

<!-- FIXME: as a matter of ANSI conformance, we are required to document -->
<!-- implementation-defined stuff, which for pathnames (chapter 19 of CLtS) -->
<!-- includes: -->
<!-- * Otherwise, the parsing of thing is implementation-defined. -->
<!-- (PARSE-NAMESTRING) -->
<!-- * If thing contains an explicit host name and no explicit device name, -->
<!-- then it is implementation-defined whether parse-namestring will supply -->
<!-- the standard default device for that host as the device component of -->
<!-- the resulting pathname.  (PARSE-NAMESTRING) -->
<!-- * The specific nature of the search is implementation-defined. -->
<!-- (LOAD-LOGICAL-PATHNAME-TRANSLATIONS) -->
<!-- * Any additional elements are implementation-defined. -->
<!-- (LOGICAL-PATHNAME-TRANSLATIONS) -->
<!-- * The matching rules are implementation-defined but should be consistent -->
<!-- with directory.  (PATHNAME-MATCH-P) -->
<!-- * Any such additional translations are implementation-defined. -->
<!-- (TRANSLATE-LOGICAL-PATHNAMES) -->
<!-- * ...or an implementation-defined portion of a component... -->
<!-- (TRANSLATE-PATHNAME) -->
<!-- * The portion of source that is copied into the resulting pathname is -->
<!-- implementation-defined.  (TRANSLATE-PATHNAME) -->
<!-- * During the copying of a portion of source into the resulting -->
<!-- pathname, additional implementation-defined translations of case or -->
<!-- file naming conventions might occur.  (TRANSLATE-PATHNAME) -->
<!-- * In general, the syntax of namestrings involves the use of -->
<!-- implementation-defined conventions.  (19.1.1) -->
<!-- * The nature of the mapping between structure imposed by pathnames and -->
<!-- the structure, if any, that is used by the underlying file system is -->
<!-- implementation-defined.  (19.1.2) -->
<!-- * The mapping of the pathname components into the concepts peculiar to -->
<!-- each file system is implementation-defined.  (19.1.2) -->
<!-- * Whether separator characters are permitted as part of a string in a -->
<!-- pathname component is implementation-defined;  (19.2.2.1.1) -->
<!-- * Whether a value of :unspecific is permitted for any component on any -->
<!-- given file system accessible to the implementation is -->
<!-- implementation-defined.  (19.2.2.2.3) -->
<!-- * Other symbols and integers have implementation-defined meaning. -->
<!-- (19.2.2.4.6) -->
<h4 class="subsection">8.1.1 The SYS Logical Pathname Host</h4>

<p><a name="index-Logical-pathnames-289"></a><a name="index-Pathnames_002c-logical-290"></a><a name="index-logical_002dpathname_002dtranslations-291"></a><a name="index-g_t_0028setf-logical_002dpathname_002dtranslations_0029-292"></a>
<!-- * The existence and meaning of SYS: logical pathnames is -->
<!-- implementation-defined.  (19.3.1.1.1) -->

   <p>The logical pathname host named by <code>"SYS"</code> exists in SBCL.  Its
<code>logical-pathname-translations</code> may be set by the site or the user
applicable to point to the locations of the system's sources; in
particular, the core system's source files match the logical pathname
<code>"SYS:SRC;**;*.*.*"</code>, and the contributed modules' source files
match <code>"SYS:CONTRIB;**;*.*.*"</code>.
