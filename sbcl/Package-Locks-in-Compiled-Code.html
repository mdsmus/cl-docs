<h4 class="subsection">10.1.4 Package Locks in Compiled Code</h4>

<h5 class="subsubsection">10.1.4.1 Interned Symbols</h5>

<p>If file-compiled code contains interned symbols, then loading that code
into an image without the said symbols will not cause a package lock
violation, even if the packages in question are locked.

<h5 class="subsubsection">10.1.4.2 Other Limitations on Compiled Code</h5>

<p>With the exception of interned symbols, behaviour is unspecified if
package locks affecting compiled code are not the same during loading
of the code or execution.

   <p>Specifically, code compiled with packages unlocked may or may not fail
to signal package-lock-violations even if the packages are locked at
runtime, and code compiled with packages locked may or may not signal
spurious package-lock-violations at runtime even if the packages are
unlocked.

   <p>In practice all this means that package-locks have a negligible
performance penalty in compiled code as long as they are not violated.
