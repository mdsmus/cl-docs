<h4 class="subsection">4.5.1 How the Source is Found</h4>

<p>If the code was defined from Lisp by <code>compile</code> or
<code>eval</code>, then the source can always be reliably located.  If the
code was defined from a <samp><span class="file">fasl</span></samp> file created by
<code>compile-file</code>, then the debugger gets the source forms it
prints by reading them from the original source file.  This is a
potential problem, since the source file might have moved or changed
since the time it was compiled.

   <p>The source file is opened using the <code>truename</code> of the source file
pathname originally given to the compiler.  This is an absolute pathname
with all logical names and symbolic links expanded.  If the file can't
be located using this name, then the debugger gives up and signals an
error.

   <p>If the source file can be found, but has been modified since the time it was
compiled, the debugger prints this warning:

<pre class="example">     ; File has been modified since compilation:
     ;   <var>filename</var>
     ; Using form offset instead of character position.
</pre>
   <p>where <var>filename</var> is the name of the source file.  It then proceeds
using a robust but not foolproof heuristic for locating the source. 
This heuristic works if:

     <ul>
<li>No top-level forms before the top-level form containing the source
have been added or deleted, and

     <li>The top-level form containing the source has not been modified much. 
(More precisely, none of the list forms beginning before the source
form have been added or deleted.)

   </ul>

   <p>If the heuristic doesn't work, the displayed source will be wrong, but will
probably be near the actual source.  If the &ldquo;shape&rdquo; of the top-level form in
the source file is too different from the original form, then an error will be
signaled.  When the heuristic is used, the source location commands are
noticeably slowed.

   <p>Source location printing can also be confused if (after the source was
compiled) a read-macro you used in the code was redefined to expand
into something different, or if a read-macro ever returns the same
<code>eq</code> list twice.  If you don't define read macros and don't use
<code>##</code> in perverted ways, you don't need to worry about this.
