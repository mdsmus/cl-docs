<h3 class="section">6.7 Stale Extensions</h3>

<p>SBCL has inherited from CMUCL various hooks to allow the user to
tweak and monitor the garbage collection process. These are somewhat
stale code, and their interface might need to be cleaned up. If you
have urgent need of them, look at the code in <samp><span class="file">src/code/gc.lisp</span></samp>
and bring it up on the developers' mailing list.

   <p>SBCL has various hooks inherited from CMUCL, like
<code>sb-ext:float-denormalized-p</code>, to allow a program to take
advantage of IEEE floating point arithmetic properties which aren't
conveniently or efficiently expressible using the ANSI standard. These
look good, and their interface looks good, but IEEE support is
slightly broken due to a stupid decision to remove some support for
infinities (because it wasn't in the ANSI spec and it didn't occur to
me that it was in the IEEE spec). If you need this stuff, take a look
at the code and bring it up on the developers' mailing
list.
