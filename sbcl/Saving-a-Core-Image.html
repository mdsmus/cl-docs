<h4 class="subsection">2.2.3 Saving a Core Image</h4>

<p>SBCL has the ability to save its state as a file for later
execution. This functionality is important for its bootstrapping
process, and is also provided as an extension to the user.

   <p><a name="Function-sb_002dext_003asave_002dlisp_002dand_002ddie"></a>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die</b><var> core-file-name &amp;key toplevel purify root-structures environment-name executable<a name="index-sb_002dext_003asave_002dlisp_002dand_002ddie-8"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-sb_002dext_003asave_002dlisp_002dand_002ddie-9"></a>Save a "core image", i.e. enough information to restart a Lisp
process later in the same state, in the file of the specified name. 
Only global state is preserved: the stack is unwound in the process.

        <p>The following <code>&amp;key</code> arguments are defined:

          <dl>
<dt><code>:toplevel</code><dd>     The function to run when the created core file is resumed. The
     default function handles command line toplevel option processing
     and runs the top level read-eval-print loop. This function should
     not return.

          <br><dt><code>:executable</code><dd>     If true, arrange to combine the <code>sbcl</code> runtime and the core image
     to create a standalone executable.  If false (the default), the
     core image will not be executable on its own.

          <br><dt><code>:purify</code><dd>     If true (the default on cheneygc), do a purifying <code>gc</code> which moves all
     dynamically allocated objects into static space. This takes
     somewhat longer than the normal <code>gc</code> which is otherwise done, but
     it's only done once, and subsequent GC's will be done less often
     and will take less time in the resulting core file. See the <code>purify</code>
     function. This parameter has no effect on platforms using the
     generational garbage collector.

          <br><dt><code>:root-structures</code><dd>     This should be a list of the main entry points in any newly loaded
     systems. This need not be supplied, but locality and/or <code>gc</code> performance
     may be better if they are. Meaningless if <code>:purify</code> is <code>nil</code>. See the
     <code>purify</code> function.

          <br><dt><code>:environment-name</code><dd>     This is also passed to the <code>purify</code> function when <code>:purify</code> is <code>t</code>. 
     (rarely used)

        </dl>

        <p>The save/load process changes the values of some global variables:

          <dl>
<dt><code>*standard-output*</code><em>, </em><code>*debug-io*</code><em>, etc.</em><dd>    Everything related to open streams is necessarily changed, since
    the <code>os</code> won't let us preserve a stream across save and load.

          <br><dt><code>*default-pathname-defaults*</code><dd>    This is reinitialized to reflect the working directory where the
    saved core is loaded.

        </dl>

        <p><code>save-lisp-and-die</code> interacts with <code>sb-alien:load-foreign-object:</code> see its
documentation for details.

        <p>On threaded platforms only a single thread may remain running after
<code>sb-ext:*save-hooks*</code> have run. Applications using multiple threads can
be <code>save-lisp-and-die</code> friendly by registering a save-hook that quits
any additional threads, and an init-hook that restarts them.

        <p>This implementation is not as polished and painless as you might like:
          <ul>
<li>It corrupts the current Lisp image enough that the current process
    needs to be killed afterwards. This can be worked around by forking
    another process that saves the core. 
<li>There is absolutely no binary compatibility of core images between
    different runtime support programs. Even runtimes built from the same
    sources at different times are treated as incompatible for this
    purpose. 
</ul>
        This isn't because we like it this way, but just because there don't
seem to be good quick fixes for either limitation and no one has been
sufficiently motivated to do lengthy fixes.
