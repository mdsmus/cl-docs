<h4 class="subsection">4.3.5 Unknown Locations and Interrupts</h4>

<p><a name="index-Unknown-code-locations-79"></a><a name="index-Locations_002c-unknown-80"></a><a name="index-Interrupts-81"></a><a name="index-Errors_002c-run_002dtime-82"></a>
The debugger operates using special debugging information attached to
the compiled code.  This debug information tells the debugger what it
needs to know about the locations in the code where the debugger can
be invoked.  If the debugger somehow encounters a location not
described in the debug information, then it is said to be
<dfn>unknown</dfn>.  If the code location for a frame is unknown, then some
variables may be inaccessible, and the source location cannot be
precisely displayed.

   <p>There are three reasons why a code location could be unknown:

     <ul>
<li>There is inadequate debug information due to the value of the <code>debug</code>
optimization quality.  See <a href="Debugger-Policy-Control.html#Debugger-Policy-Control">Debugger Policy Control</a>.

     <li>The debugger was entered because of an interrupt such as &lt;C-c&gt;.

     <li>A hardware error such as &ldquo;&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bus error</span></samp>&rsquo;&rdquo; occurred in code that was
compiled unsafely due to the value of the <code>safety</code> optimization
quality. 
<!-- FIXME: reinstate link when section on optimize qualities exists. -->
<!-- @xref{optimize-declaration}. -->

   </ul>

   <p>In the last two cases, the values of argument variables are
accessible, but may be incorrect.  For more details on when variable
values are accessible, <a href="Variable-Value-Availability.html#Variable-Value-Availability">Variable Value Availability</a>.

   <p>It is possible for an interrupt to happen when a function call or
return is in progress.  The debugger may then flame out with some
obscure error or insist that the bottom of the stack has been reached,
when the real problem is that the current stack frame can't be
located.  If this happens, return from the interrupt and try again.
