   <p>Since SBCL's compiler does much more comprehensive type checking than
most Lisp compilers, SBCL may detect type errors in programs that have
been debugged using other compilers. These errors are mostly incorrect
declarations, although compile-time type errors can find actual bugs
if parts of the program have never been tested.

   <p>Some incorrect declarations can only be detected by run-time type
checking. It is very important to initially compile a program with
full type checks (high <code>safety</code> optimization) and then test this
safe version. After the checking version has been tested, then you can
consider weakening or eliminating type checks.  <em>This applies
even to previously debugged programs,</em> because the SBCL compiler does
much more type inference than other Common Lisp compilers, so an
incorrect declaration can do more damage.

   <p>The most common problem is with variables whose constant initial value
doesn't match the type declaration. Incorrect constant initial values
will always be flagged by a compile-time type error, and they are
simple to fix once located. Consider this code fragment:

<pre class="lisp">     (prog (foo)
       (declare (fixnum foo))
       (setq foo ...)
       ...)
</pre>
   <p>Here <code>foo</code> is given an initial value of <code>nil</code>, but is
declared to be a <code>fixnum</code>.  Even if it is never read, the initial
value of a variable must match the declared type.  There are two ways
to fix this problem. Change the declaration

<pre class="lisp">     (prog (foo)
       (declare (type (or fixnum null) foo))
       (setq foo ...)
       ...)
</pre>
   <p>or change the initial value

<pre class="lisp">     (prog ((foo 0))
       (declare (fixnum foo))
       (setq foo ...)
       ...)
</pre>
   <p>It is generally preferable to change to a legal initial value rather
than to weaken the declaration, but sometimes it is simpler to weaken
the declaration than to try to make an initial value of the
appropriate type.

   <p>Another declaration problem occasionally encountered is incorrect
declarations on <code>defmacro</code> arguments. This can happen when a
function is converted into a macro. Consider this macro:

<pre class="lisp">     (defmacro my-1+ (x)
       (declare (fixnum x))
       `(the fixnum (1+ ,x)))
</pre>
   <p>Although legal and well-defined Common Lisp code, this meaning of this
definition is almost certainly not what the writer intended. For
example, this call is illegal:

<pre class="lisp">     (my-1+ (+ 4 5))
</pre>
   <p>This call is illegal because the argument to the macro is <code>(+ 4
5)</code>, which is a <code>list</code>, not a <code>fixnum</code>.  Because of macro
semantics, it is hardly ever useful to declare the types of macro
arguments.  If you really want to assert something about the type of
the result of evaluating a macro argument, then put a <code>the</code> in
the expansion:

<pre class="lisp">     (defmacro my-1+ (x)
       `(the fixnum (1+ (the fixnum ,x))))
</pre>
   <p>In this case, it would be stylistically preferable to change this
macro back to a function and declare it inline. 
<!-- <!-FIXME: <xref>inline-expansion, once we crib the -->
<!-- relevant text from the CMU CL manual.-> -->

   <p>Some more subtle problems are caused by incorrect declarations that
can't be detected at compile time.  Consider this code:

<pre class="lisp">     (do ((pos 0 (position #\a string :start (1+ pos))))
       ((null pos))
       (declare (fixnum pos))
       ...)
</pre>
   <p>Although <code>pos</code> is almost always a <code>fixnum</code>, it is <code>nil</code>
at the end of the loop. If this example is compiled with full type
checks (the default), then running it will signal a type error at the
end of the loop. If compiled without type checks, the program will go
into an infinite loop (or perhaps <code>position</code> will complain
because <code>(1+ nil)</code> isn't a sensible start.) Why? Because if you
compile without type checks, the compiler just quietly believes the
type declaration. Since the compiler believes that <code>pos</code> is
always a <code>fixnum</code>, it believes that <code>pos</code> is never
<code>nil</code>, so <code>(null pos)</code> is never true, and the loop exit test
is optimized away. Such errors are sometimes flagged by unreachable
code notes, but it is still important to initially compile and test
any system with full type checks, even if the system works fine when
compiled using other compilers.

   <p>In this case, the fix is to weaken the type declaration to <code>(or
fixnum null)</code> <a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.

   <p>Note that there is usually little performance penalty for weakening a
declaration in this way. Any numeric operations in the body can still
assume that the variable is a <code>fixnum</code>, since <code>nil</code> is not a
legal numeric argument. Another possible fix would be to say:

<pre class="lisp">     (do ((pos 0 (position #\a string :start (1+ pos))))
         ((null pos))
       (let ((pos pos))
         (declare (fixnum pos))
         ...))
</pre>
   <p>This would be preferable in some circumstances, since it would allow a
non-standard representation to be used for the local <code>pos</code>
variable in the loop body.

SBCL, since it already knows that <code>position</code> returns a
