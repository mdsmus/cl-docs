<h4 class="subsection">10.1.5 Operations Violating Package Locks</h4>

<h5 class="subsubsection">10.1.5.1 Operations on Packages</h5>

<p>The following actions cause a package lock violation if the package
operated on is locked, and <code>*package*</code> is not an implementation
package of that package, and the action would cause a change in the
state of the package (so e.g. exporting already external symbols is
never a violation). Package lock violations caused by these operations
signal errors of type <code>sb-ext:package-locked-error</code>.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Shadowing a symbol in a package.

     <li>Importing a symbol to a package.

     <li>Uninterning a symbol from a package.

     <li>Exporting a symbol from a package.

     <li>Unexporting a symbol from a package.

     <li>Changing the packages used by a package.

     <li>Renaming a package.

     <li>Deleting a package.

        </ol>

<h5 class="subsubsection">10.1.5.2 Operations on Symbols</h5>

<p>Following actions cause a package lock violation if the home package
of the symbol operated on is locked, and <code>*package*</code> is not an
implementation package of that package. Package lock violations caused
by these action signal errors of type
<code>sb-ext:symbol-package-locked-error</code>.

   <p>These actions cause only one package lock violation per lexically
apparent violated package.

   <p>Example:

<pre class="lisp">     ;;; Packages FOO and BAR are locked.
     ;;;
     ;;; Two lexically apparent violated packages: exactly two
     ;;; package-locked-errors will be signalled.
     
     (defclass foo:point ()
       ((x :accessor bar:x)
        (y :accessor bar:y)))
</pre>
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Binding or altering its value lexically or dynamically, or
establishing it as a symbol-macro.

     <p>Exceptions:

          <ul>
<li>If the symbol is not defined as a constant, global symbol-macro or a
global dynamic variable, it may be lexically bound or established as a
local symbol macro.

          <li>If the symbol is defined as a global dynamic variable, it may be
assigned or bound.

     </ul>

     <li>Defining, undefining, or binding it, or its setf name as a function.

     <p>Exceptions:

          <ul>
<li>If the symbol is not defined as a function, macro, or special operator
it and its setf name may be lexically bound as a function.

     </ul>

     <li>Defining, undefining, or binding it as a macro or compiler macro.

     <p>Exceptions:

          <ul>
<li>If the symbol is not defined as a function, macro, or special operator
it may be lexically bound as a macro.

     </ul>

     <li>Defining it as a type specifier or structure.

     <li>Defining it as a declaration with a declaration proclamation.

     <li>Declaring or proclaiming it special.

     <li>Declaring or proclaiming its type or ftype.

     <p>Exceptions:

          <ul>
<li>If the symbol may be lexically bound, the type of that binding may be
declared.

          <li>If the symbol may be lexically bound as a function, the ftype of that
binding may be declared.

     </ul>

     <li>Defining a setf expander for it.

     <li>Defining it as a method combination type.

     <li>Using it as the class-name argument to setf of find-class.

        </ol>
