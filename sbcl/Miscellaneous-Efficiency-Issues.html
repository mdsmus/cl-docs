<h3 class="section">5.4 Miscellaneous Efficiency Issues</h3>

<p>FIXME: The material in the CMUCL manual about getting good
performance from the compiler should be reviewed, reformatted in
Texinfo, lightly edited for SBCL, and substituted into this
manual. In the meantime, the original CMUCL manual is still 95+%
correct for the SBCL version of the Python compiler. See the
sections

     <ul>
<li>Advanced Compiler Use and Efficiency Hints
<li>Advanced Compiler Introduction
<li>More About Types in Python
<li>Type Inference
<li>Source Optimization
<li>Tail Recursion
<li>Local Call
<li>Block Compilation
<li>Inline Expansion
<li>Object Representation
<li>Numbers
<li>General Efficiency Hints
<li>Efficiency Notes
</ul>

   <p>Besides this information from the CMUCL manual, there are a few other
points to keep in mind.

     <ul>
<li>The CMUCL manual doesn't seem to state it explicitly, but Python has a
mental block about type inference when assignment is involved. Python
is very aggressive and clever about inferring the types of values
bound with <code>let</code>, <code>let*</code>, inline function call, and so
forth. However, it's much more passive and dumb about inferring the
types of values assigned with <code>setq</code>, <code>setf</code>, and
friends. It would be nice to fix this, but in the meantime don't
expect that just because it's very smart about types in most respects
it will be smart about types involved in assignments.  (This doesn't
affect its ability to benefit from explicit type declarations
involving the assigned variables, only its ability to get by without
explicit type declarations.)

     <!-- <!- FIXME: Python dislikes assignments, but not in type -->
     <!-- inference. The real problems are loop induction, closed over -->
     <!-- variables and aliases. -> -->
     <li>Since the time the CMUCL manual was written, CMUCL (and thus SBCL) has
gotten a generational garbage collector. This means that there are
some efficiency implications of various patterns of memory usage which
aren't discussed in the CMUCL manual. (Some new material should be
written about this.)

     <li>SBCL has some important known efficiency problems.  Perhaps the most
important are

          <ul>
<li>The garbage collector is not particularly efficient, at least on
platforms without the generational collector (as of SBCL 0.8.9, all
except x86).

          <li>Various aspects of the PCL implementation of CLOS are more inefficient
than necessary.

     </ul>

   </ul>

   <p>Finally, note that Common Lisp defines many constructs which, in
the infamous phrase, &ldquo;could be compiled efficiently by a
sufficiently smart compiler&rdquo;. The phrase is infamous because
making a compiler which actually is sufficiently smart to find all
these optimizations systematically is well beyond the state of the art
of current compiler technology. Instead, they're optimized on a
case-by-case basis by hand-written code, or not optimized at all if
the appropriate case hasn't been hand-coded. Some cases where no such
hand-coding has been done as of SBCL version 0.6.3 include

     <ul>
<li><code>(reduce #'f x)</code> where the type of <code>x</code> is known at compile
time

     <li>various bit vector operations, e.g.  <code>(position 0
some-bit-vector)</code>

     <li>specialized sequence idioms, e.g.  <code>(remove item list :count 1)</code>

     <li>cases where local compilation policy does not require excessive type
checking, e.g.  <code>(locally (declare (safety 1)) (assoc item
list))</code> (which currently performs safe <code>endp</code> checking internal
to assoc).

   </ul>

   <p>If your system's performance is suffering because of some construct
which could in principle be compiled efficiently, but which the SBCL
compiler can't in practice compile efficiently, consider writing a
patch to the compiler and submitting it for inclusion in the main
sources. Such code is often reasonably straightforward to write;
search the sources for the string &ldquo;<code>deftransform</code>&rdquo; to find many
examples (some straightforward, some less so).
