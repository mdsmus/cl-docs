The assignment introduces object-oriented programming and a simple model
of inheritance.  The object system presented here is based on the one
presented by J. Rees and N. Adams, ``Object-oriented programming in
Scheme,'' in the <em>1988 ACM Conference on Lisp and Functional
Programming</em>.  One of the underlying messages here is that in a
language like Scheme, which includes first-class procedures, it is
easy to implement a variety of object-oriented programming models.  If
you plan to use this assignment, we recommend that you 
present a lecture on the material covered in the supplementary notes
included below.

<p>

The actual assignment has students extend and modify an
adventure-style game, where the objects are people, places, and
various magical things.  The particular setup presented here includes
a lot of MIT-specific places and jokes, and you should modify it
accordingly.  The inclusion of a troll who eats the course lecturers,
or consigns them to some other horrible fate, is highly recommended.
