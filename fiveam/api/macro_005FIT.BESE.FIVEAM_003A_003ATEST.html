  >Create a suite named NAME. If NAME is a list it must be of the
form:

  (name &amp;key depends-on suite)

NAME is the symbol which names the test.

DEPENDS-ON is a list of the form:

 (AND . test-names) - This test is run only if all of the tests
 in TEST-NAMES have passed, otherwise a single test-skipped
 result is generated.

 (OR . test-names) - If any of TEST-NAMES has passed this test is
 run, otherwise a test-skipped result is generated.

 (NOT test-name) - This is test is run only if TEST-NAME failed.

AND, OR and NOT can be combined to produce complex dependencies.

If DEPENDS-ON is a symbol it is interpreted as `(AND
,depends-on), this is accomadate the common case of one test
depending on another.

SUITE defaults to the current value of *SUITE*.</blockquote
