<h3 class="section">4.1 What makes Lisp different</h3>

<p>The following sums up how bindings to foreign libraries are usually
implemented in other languages, then in Common Lisp:

     <dl>
<dt>Perl, Python, Java, other one-implementation languages<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040acronym_007bSWIG_007d-3"></a><a name="index-Perl-4"></a><a name="index-Python-5"></a>Bindings are implemented as shared objects written in C.  In some
cases, the C code is generated by a tool, such as <acronym>SWIG</acronym>, but
the result is the same: a new C library that manually translates
between the language implementation's objects, such as <code>PyObject</code>
in Python, and whatever C object is called for, often using C
functions provided by the implementation.  It also translates between
the calling conventions of the language and C.

     <br><dt>Common Lisp<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040acronym_007bSLIME_007d-6"></a>Bindings are written in Lisp.  They can be created at-will by Lisp
programs.  Lisp programmers can write new bindings and add them to the
image, using a listener such as <acronym>SLIME</acronym>, as easily as with
regular Lisp definitions.  The only foreign library to load is the one
being wrapped&mdash;the one with the pure C interface; no C or other
non-Lisp compilation is required. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-advantages-of-_0040acronym_007bFFI_007d-7"></a><a name="index-benefits-of-_0040acronym_007bFFI_007d-8"></a>We believe the advantages of the Common Lisp approach far outweigh any
disadvantages.  Incremental development with a listener can be as
productive for C binding development as it is with other Lisp
development.  Keeping it &ldquo;in the [Lisp] family&rdquo;, as it were, makes
it much easier for you and other Lisp programmers to load and use the
bindings.  Common Lisp implementations such as <acronym>CMUCL</acronym>, freed
from having to provide a C interface to their own objects, are thus
freed to be implemented in another language (as <acronym>CMUCL</acronym> is)
while still allowing programmers to call foreign functions.

   <p><a name="index-minimal-bindings-9"></a>Perhaps the greatest advantage is that using an <acronym>FFI</acronym> doesn't
obligate you to become a professional binding developer.  Writers of
bindings for other languages usually end up maintaining or failing to
maintain complete bindings to the foreign library.  Using an
<acronym>FFI</acronym>, however, means if you only need one or two functions,
you can write bindings for only those functions, and be assured that
you can just as easily add to the bindings if need be.

   <p><a name="index-C-abstractions-10"></a><a name="index-abstractions-in-C-11"></a>The removal of the C compiler, or C interpretation of any kind,
creates the main disadvantage: some of C's &ldquo;abstractions&rdquo; are not
available, violating information encapsulation.  For example,
<code>struct</code>s that must be passed on the stack, or used as return
values, without corresponding functional abstractions to create and
manage the <code>struct</code>s, must be declared explicitly in Lisp.  This
is fine for structs whose contents are &ldquo;public&rdquo;, but is not so
pleasant when a struct is supposed to be &ldquo;opaque&rdquo; by convention,
even though it is not so defined.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>

   <p>Without an abstraction to create the struct, Lisp needs to be able to
lay out the struct in memory, so must know its internal details.

   <p><a name="index-workaround-for-C-12"></a>In these cases, you can create a minimal C library to provide the
missing abstractions, without destroying all the advantages of the
Common Lisp approach discussed above.  In the case of <code>struct</code>s,
you can write simple, pure C functions that tell you how many bytes a
struct requires or allocate new structs, read and write fields of the
struct, or whatever operations are supposed to be
public.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a>

   <blockquote>
<strong>Implementor's note:</strong> <em>cffi-grovel, a project not yet part of <acronym>CFFI</acronym>, automates
this and other processes.</em>
</blockquote>

   <p>Another disadvantage appears when you would rather use the foreign
language than Lisp.  However, someone who prefers C to Lisp is not a
likely candidate for developing a Lisp interface to a C library.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> Admittedly, this is an
advanced issue, and we encourage you to leave this text until you are
more familiar with how <acronym>CFFI</acronym> works.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-2" href="#fnd-2">2</a>]</small> This does not apply to structs whose contents are
intended to be part of the public library interface.  In those cases,
a pure Lisp struct definition is always preferred.  In fact, many
prefer to stay in Lisp and break the encapsulation anyway, placing the
burden of correct library interface definition on the library.</p>
