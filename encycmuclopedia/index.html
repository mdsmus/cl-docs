<H2><A NAME="intro">Introduction</A></H2>

<P>In this section you will find information about the purpose of the
EncyCMUCLopedia, its availability and structure, its copyright and
licensing status, and how to provide feedback to the editor.


<H3><A NAME="overview">Overview</A></H3>

<P>This is the <EM>EncyCMUCLopedia</EM>, an extensive collection of
documents concerning <A HREF="http://www.cons.org/cmucl/"><EM>CMU Common
Lisp</EM></A> (CMU CL; a <A
HREF="http://www.laas.fr/~emarsden/cons.org/">more complete and up to date
site</A> is maintained by Eric Marsden). CMU CL is a free, high-quality
ANSI Common Lisp system for Unix workstations originally developed at the
<A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/">School of Computer Science at Carnegie
Mellon University</A>.

<P>The EncyCMUCLopedia is intended as a resource for both <A
HREF="#user-doc">users</A> and <A HREF="#impl-doc">implementors</A>. Its
purpose is to package and present all useful material directly related to
CMU CL. The EncyCMUCLopedia does not contain, however, references to
introductory Common Lisp material, for which you may check the Web site of
the <A HREF="http://www.alu.org/">Association of Lisp Users</A> (ALU). It
is not a tutorial or reference guide to CMU CL either.

<P>The documents included here were written at different times by different
authors, mostly CMU CL developers. The information they contain may be
incomplete, incorrect or out of date. It is your responsibility to check
its accuracy. As the editor of the EncyCMUCLopedia I look for interesting
material, organize it, add appropriate comments and cross references to an
index, and package the collection for distribution. See <A
HREF="#method">below</A> for information on how documents are selected and
organized.

<P>All material written in the context of the CMU CL project, and the
EncyCMUCLopedia as an aggregation of content, comes with the following
<STRONG>lack of warranty</STRONG>:

<BLOCKQUOTE>This software is distributed in the hope that it will be
useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY. The author(s) do not accept

of any kind, either expressed or implied.

In no event will the author(s) or their institutions be liable to you for

or consequential damages arising out of or in connection with the use or
inability to use (including but not limited to loss of data or data being
rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by third parties or a failure of
the program to operate as documented) the program, even if you have been
advised of the possibility of such damages, or for any claim by any other
party, whether in an action of contract, negligence, or other tortious
action.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>For documents prepared in other contexts each entry contains
appropriate <STRONG>copyright</STRONG>, lack of warranty and licensing
information. Check these conditions before redistributing part or all of
this collection, or before preparing derivative works.

<H3><A NAME="distribution">Getting and Installing the
EncyCMUCLopedia</A></H3>

<P>The EncyCMUCLopedia packages in a single collection most of the existing
documentation on CMU CL. It also comes with a sort of annotated
bibliography, the page you are reading now, with comments and links to the
actual documents.

<P>The distribution of the EncyCMUCLopedia is available at:

<PRE>
<A
HREF="http://cvs2.cons.org:8000/cmucl/doc/EncyCMUCLopedia/">http://cvs2.cons.org:8000/cmucl/doc/EncyCMUCLopedia/</A>
</PRE>

and consists of a compressed archive whose name has the following
structure:

<PRE>
encycmuclopedia-<EM>yyyymmdd[</EM>d<EM>]</EM>.tar.gz
encycmuclopedia-<EM>yyyymmdd[</EM>d<EM>]</EM>.tar.bz2
</PRE>

where the date <CODE><EM>yyyymmdd</EM></CODE> provides version information
and the optional <CODE>d</CODE> character flags draft releases. The version
with the <CODE>bz2</CODE> extension was processed with the more space
efficient <CODE>bzip2</CODE> file compressor.

<P>To install the EncyCMUCLopedia you need about 10MB of disk space. Just
extract the compressed archive in a suitable directory such as
<CODE>/usr/local/lib/cmucl</CODE>. Then open file <CODE>index.html</CODE>
in <CODE>doc</CODE>, the top-level directory of the distribution, with any
Web browser.

<H3><A NAME="method">Document Selection and Organization</A></H3>

<P>This collection includes material directly related to the CMU CL system,
its development environment, language extensions and libraries. Since CMU
CL is mostly compliant with <A
HREF="http://www.xanalys.com/software_tools/reference/HyperSpec/FrontMatter/">ANSI
Common Lisp</A>, general and introductory Common Lisp and CLOS documents
have been left out from the EncyCMUCLopedia.

<P>Any Common Lisp or CLOS book is a good source of information about
standard language features. If you are interested in such material, check
the Web site of the <A HREF="http://www.alu.org/">Association of Lisp
Users</A> (ALU) or download the CMU CL <A
HREF="http://www.debian.org/Packages/stable/devel/cmucl.html">distribution
for Debian Linux</A>, which comes with Common Lisp and CLOS tutorials.

<P>The documents in the EncyCMUCLopedia come from different sources and may
be incomplete, inaccurate or out of date. They may also not cover all the
features of the system and its use. Therefore, their grouping in the
following sections reflects the state of available material, not a
comprehensive and accurate classification of CMU CL's features. In other
words, if a topic is not mentioned in the EncyCMUCLopedia, there's probably
no documentation about it.

<P>Documents are listed in <STRONG>entries</STRONG> similar to the
following sample one:

<DL>
  <DT><EM>Document title</EM> (within each section, titles are sorted in
      alphabetical order)
      <BR><SMALL>Author(s) -- Last modification date</SMALL>
      <BR>[PostScript] [PDF] [HTML] [ASCII] [Online version] [Additional
      online material]: links to the available formats for the document
      (you may need to configure your Web browser to view some of them),
      and possibly to the latest online version and additional material,
      such as source code or scripts
  <DD>Description of the document's purpose and content.
      <P><SMALL>Copyright and licensing information.</SMALL>
</DL>

Information about authors and modification dates is included only if
known. Some documents may be available in only one format. For a few of the
documents, only links to the Web sites where they are accessible are
provided.

<H3><A NAME="feedback">Feedback</A></H3>

<P>Feedback on the EncyCMUCLopedia is welcome and encouraged. If you have
comments or suggestions, or you are willing to contribute new documents or
corrections, write to Paolo Amoroso <A
HREF="mailto:amoroso@mclink.it"><CODE>amoroso@mclink.it</CODE></A>. Feel
free to critique every aspect of this work, from the selection of documents
to the layout of this index, from its content to my unoptimized English
compiler.

<H3><A NAME="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</A></H3>

<P>I would like to thank all those who provided me with help and
encouragement for this project. Marco Antoniotti sent me the Motif
interface documents he converted to LaTeX2e. Daniel Barlow contributed
documents from his Web site. Gary Byers contributed the notes on the
PowerPC port. Martin Cracauer hosted the EncyCMUCLopedia at <A
HREF="http://www.cons.org/"><CODE>cons.org</CODE></A> and provided some
material. Vinodh Das pointed out some &quot;stealth&quot; typos. Jerry
Gregg contributed his article on installing CMU CL. Robert MacLachlan and
Pierre R. Mai granted permission to include their newsgroup and mailing
list messages. William Harold Newman shared his notes on SBCL. I thank
Antonio Piccolboni for his feedback -- and you should thank him too,
because he spared you the trouble of reading early drafts of the
EncyCMUCLopedia. Russ Urquhart kindly converted the CLX reference manual to
PostScript and PDF from the Interleaf source, probably making it possible
to comfortably browse it for the first time in the history of
Lispkind. Peter Van Eynde put together an extensive collection of CMU CL
documents, from which I took some material.

<P>Fortunately for them, I take all the responsibility for any errors,
inaccuracies or omissions in this work. But unfortunately for them, I take
all the fun of the project.

<H2><A NAME="paths">Suggested Reading Paths</A></H2>

<P>It is not necessary to read all the material referenced in the
EncyCMUCLopedia. Users are often interested in quickly accessing the
documentation that may help them in solving particular problems with CMU
CL, or in using the system and its tools to perform various tasks.

<P>So the following subsections are structured around typical
<STRONG>goal-based user profiles</STRONG>. Read their introductions to see
whether they match the tasks you are interested in. If so, follow the
suggested steps. The paths are ordered so that background material, and
other important or relevant information, is given first. If you find what
you need before the end of a path you may safely skip the remaining
entries.

<P>Regardless of the user's goals, the <A HREF="#userman"><EM>CMU Common
Lisp User's Manual</EM></A> should probably be a <STRONG>required
reading</STRONG> for everybody.


<H3><A NAME="paths-using">Using CMU Common Lisp</A></H3>

<P>If you are a Common Lisp programmer who needs to become familiar with
CMU CL, or you are new to the language and need to install and use the
system, this reading path is for you. You may stop at step 4 if you would
just like to learn more about CMU CL in order to decide whether it's the
right system for you. Here is what you may do:

<OL>
  <LI>learn about the features of CMU CL by checking the <A
      HREF="#man-cmucl"><CODE>cmucl</CODE> online manual page</A>
  <LI>read <A HREF="#linux-howto"><EM>CMU Common Lisp on Linux</EM></A> and
      <A HREF="#installing-18c-on-rh70"><EM>Installing CMU CL 18c on Red
      Hat Linux 7.0</EM></A> for installation and configuration information
  <LI>read the <A HREF="#man-lisp"><CODE>lisp</CODE> online manual page</A>
      for general usage information
  <LI>carefully read the CMU CL <A HREF="#userman">user's manual</A> -- you
      may want to <STRONG>print</STRONG> it and keep it handy (in case of
      problems with CMU CL, skim the latest <A HREF="#cmucl-notes">release
      notes</A>)
  <LI>if you can not use or do not like the Emacs editor, read the <A
      HREF="#hem-userman">Hemlock user's manual</A>
  <LI>if your applications are based on CLOS, check the <A
      HREF="#clos-user">information and tips</A> for using PCL
  <LI>if your applications require multi-processing, available only on the
      <STRONG>x86 port</STRONG>, read about <A HREF="#threads">threads</A>
      and <A HREF="#locks">locks</A>
  <LI>if you are interested in graphics programming, read about <A
      HREF="#clm-man">CLM</A>, how it is <A
      HREF="#motif-interface">accessed from CMU CL</A>, and the <A
      HREF="#motif-design">differences with the CMU CL implementation</A>

<H3><A NAME="paths-modifying">Modifying CMU Common Lisp</A></H3>

<P>This reading path is for you if you need to build CMU CL from source
because you have slightly modified the system, added minor features, or you
would just like to customize it. Follow these steps:

<OL>
  <LI>learn how to <A HREF="#compilation-howto">build CMU CL from
      source</A> by following the appropriate <A
      HREF="#compilation-steps">compilation steps</A> (there are <A
      HREF="#build-debian">specific instructions</A> for the <STRONG>Debian
      Linux</STRONG> port</A>)
  <LI>for learning how to change the behavior of PCL without rebuilding the
      system, check the <A HREF="#mop">Metaobject Protocol</A>
  <LI>if you need to customize the Hemlock editor or add new features to
      it, read the <A HREF="#hem-imp">command implementor's manual</A>
  <LI>you may want to skim the manual that discusses the <A
      HREF="#cmucl-design">design of CMU CL</A>
</OL>

<H3><A NAME="paths-contributing">Contributing to the Development of CMU
Common Lisp</A></H3>

<P>If you are an experienced Common Lisp programmer and you would like to
do major changes to CMU CL, contribute to its maintenance and further
development, or simply understand how it works, this reading path is for
you. First become familiar with <A HREF="#paths-modifying">building and
modifying</A> the system, then follow these further steps:

<OL>
  <LI>read the manual that discusses the <A HREF="#cmucl-design">design of
      CMU CL</A>
  <LI>read about the <A HREF="#data-types">representation of data types</A>
  <LI>read about the <A HREF="#mem-layout">memory layout</A>
  <LI>if you need to modify or extend PCL, read about its <A
      HREF="#pcl-lap">method lookup strategies</A>
  <LI>if you develop for the <STRONG>MIPS</STRONG> architecture, read the
      notes on <A HREF="#mips-call">calling conventions</A>, <A
      HREF="#mips-regs">register usage</A> and <A HREF="#mips-issues">other
      relevant issues</A>
  <LI>check the <A HREF="#sbcl-cmucl">overview of the changes</A> to CMU CL
      in order to produce SBCL, and see whether you are able to contribute

      <P>Concerning design choices, the manual describes data
      representation, garbage collection strategies, interrupt processing
      and other implementation dependent issues. It also extensively
      discusses Python (the CMU CL compiler; no relation with the Python
      programming language), and the programming styles and techniques it
      encourages.

      <P>The tools presented in the manual are the source level debugger
      and its programming interface, the profiler, and the Python
      compiler. Note, however, that this document does not deal with the
      Hemlock editor, which comes with a separate <A

      <P>The language extensions described in CMU CL's user manual are the
      facilities for running external programs, a Unix interface, event
      dispatching facilities, a foreign function call interface, and
      support for interprocess communication and remote procedure call. The
      CMU CL multi-processing extension is currently available only on the

  <DD>Compiling CMU CL from source is tricky both because the system, being
      based on a <EM>self-compiler</EM> (a compiler written in its own
      language), requires an already running CMU CL system, and because it
      interacts in complicated ways with the build environment.

      <STRONG>out of date</STRONG>, explains the compilation process and

  <DD>Around 1997 Gary Byers ported CMU CL, with sources from a prerelease
      of the 18a branch, to the PowerPC architecture under MkLinux DR3 (the
      kernel was probably 2.0.32, with a pre-<CODE>glibc</CODE>
      <CODE>libc</CODE> snapshot that had been ported to the PowerPC). These
      notes from that project deal with memory addresses, Lisp kernel and
      signal handling, Unix interface, backend issues and more. They are
      useful to developers interested in reviving the port.

      <P>Gary's compiler code has been integrated into the main CMU CL
      source tree and updated for changes since it was written. The C code
      and some of the supporting Lisp code has not been integrated yet, and
      it may need some work before it can run.

      -- ISBN 0-262-61074-4).

      <P>The document included here is the part of the book -- chapters 5

  <DD>CLM is a Common Lisp interface to the OSF Motif X Window toolkit. CMU
      CL supports a similar interface, the Motif Toolkit Interface, which
      is based on a server that provides Lisp clients with access to Motif
      functions through remote procedure call facilities.

      such as packet formats, object representation and server
      structure. The document also summarizes the
      <STRONG>differences</STRONG> with CLM. For more information about
