<h1><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h1>

<p><b>Warning: Contents under pressure</b>.

<h2>The Rant</h2>

<p> I kept hearing nice things about Lisp.  Speak to anyone who
programmed real systems prior to the widespread adoption of Unix (if
your local stores don't stock them, try ``The Unix-Haters'
Handbook''), and you find that a typical Lisp system has (had) amazing
programmer productivity tools: online hypertexted manuals,
cross-reference things, call-graph generators, code coverage
generators, an advanced debugger, incremental development and testing
utilities, and so forth.  Ten years later, gdb on Linux doesn't work
properly with threads and shared libraries, Emacs can't indent Perl
correctly, a new exploit caused by a programmer's careless use of
fixed-length string buffers is found every week in some utility or
other, <I>weird shared library</i> things happen when you don't expect
them to, and the program taking most of the available memory on my
computer is a glorified help file viewer with a tcp sockets interface
stuck on it.  This is progress?

<h2>The Point</h2>

<p> ``The Lisp programming environment'' has the potential to be a lot
better than ``the Unix programming environment''.  Right now it
doesn't come that way out of the box (for values of `it' constrained
to `free libre Lisp setups that work on Linux/x86') and if you're new
to Lisp, setting it up so it <i>does</i> is about as much fun as, say,
learning sendmail.cf rewrite rules without use of the Bat book.  

<p>So, the aim of this document isn't to tell you how to program Lisp
(there are some good books on that, see the <a
href="#references">References</a> section at the end), it's to provide
a roadmap towards a comfortable free Lisp programming environment
based on Linux/x86.  I'm trying to cover the gaps in the textbook
where it says ``your local wizard will be able to tell you how to do
this'' - not that I qualify on either count, but the experience of
figuring it out without one is still fresh in my mind.

<h2>Conventions</h2>

<p>A number of syntactic conventions have been adopted throughout this
document.  Most of them are pretty obvious, but just in case:

<ul>

<li><tt>typewriter</tt> text refers to commands, Lisp names, and
general `computerish' things.  

<li> <i>italic</i> text is for variables: for example, if I write 

<blockquote>
To compile <i>filename</i><tt>.lisp</tt>, type <tt>(compile-file
"</tt><i>filename</i><tt>")</tt>
</blockquote>

you should be able to work out that <tt>(compile-file "foo")</tt> is what
you type to compile <tt>foo.lisp</tt>.  Frankly, if you're fluent in
English and that wasn't obvious anyway, you probably have more
pressing problems than learning Lisp.

<li> Sometimes examples to be typed in are shown.  The system's prompt
is usually left in to indicate what kind of thing to type them into: 
<tt>$</tt> is a Bourne-style shell (csh weenies will need to do their
own translation), <tt>&#35;</tt> is the same thing again, but you'll
need to be super-user, and <tt>*</tt> is the CMUCL prompt character,
so really that means `cause this to be evaluated as a Lisp
expression'.  Thus

<pre>
$ id
uid=500(dan) gid=500(dan) groups=500(dan),100(users)
* (+ 1 2)
3
# /sbin/reboot
</pre>

<p>That last one doesn't seem to produce much output.  Odd, that.

</ul>



<h1><a name="you_will_need">You will need</a></h1>

<h2>To know things</h2>

<p> To get much value from this document, you will need a basic
understanding of Linux or other Unix, and of Emacs.  You should know
what to do when I write "copy the resulting file to
<tt>/usr/lib/cmucl/lisp.core</tt>", and you should know what to do
when I write "evaluate this by pressing M-C-x" or "add this to your
.emacs"

<h2>Linux</h2>

<p>Obviously.  To set up a Lisp environment like mine, you need a
Linux system like mine.  That means libc 6.0 (glibc 2.0) or 6.1 (2.1).
Suitable distributions include 

<ul> 
<li> Red Hat 5.1, 5.2 - glibc 2.0
<li> Red Hat 6.0 - glibc 2.1
<li> Debian 2.1 (`slink') - glibc 2.0
<li> Debian 2.2 (`potato') - glibc 2.1
</ul>

<p> If you're using Glibc 2.1 you need to be running linux 2.2.13 (or
maybe 2.3.x) and to have configured the kernel for 1Gb max physical
memory not 2Gb.  This advice applies to cmucl 2.4.17; newer versions
have since been released so I may be out of date.

<h2>CMUCL</h2>

<P> The four basic options for ANSI-ish Common Lisp on Linux are
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://clisp.cons.org/">CLISP</a> - free, small,
bytecode
<li> <a href="http://cmucl.cons.org/">CMUCL</a> - free, large,
native code
<li> <a href="http://www.franz.com">Allegro Common Lisp</a> -
evaluation version of their proprietary system.  
<li> <a href="http://www.harlequin.com">Harlequin LispWorks</a>  -
evaluation version of their proprietary system.  Time-limited.
</ul>

<p> The choice between CMUCL and CLISP is mostly a size/speed
tradeoff, except for some `oddball' uses - CLISP has very fast bignum
support but a bit missing from its CLOS support.  I don't attempt here
to give arguments for one or the other, so go and decide which you'd
rather use, and come back here if you choose CMUCL.

<p> CMUCL is my choice for fast execution and near-ANSI compliance.
It's written in Common Lisp in a rather unportable fashion, so if you
want to compile it yourself you'll need a working binary package
installed first anyway.  It's currently at version 18b, but you're
less likely to find that actual version anywhere than you are to find
the Debian-packaged version which is basically the same.  Debian
`slink' (glibc 2.0-based) has 2.4.8, `potato' (2.1-based) has 2.4.20.
Pick the one appropriate to your libc version, and if your system
doesn't understand Debian packages, <tt>alien</tt> can translate them
for you.

<h2>alien</h2>

<p>If you don't use the Debian package system, you will need alien to
convert the CMUCL packages into a format you can use.  It's available
from <a href="http://kitenet.net/programs/alien/">
http://kitenet.net/programs/alien/</a>


<h2>The HyperSpec</h2>

<p> Common Lisp has an ANSI standard (X3.226-1994, for the curious).
It's distributed on laminar carbon media (a.k.a. paper) and it costs money.

<p>The <a
href="http://www.harlequin.com/education/books/HyperSpec/FrontMatter/index.html">
Common Lisp HyperSpec</a><sup>(TM)</sup> is not officially that
standard, but except in cases of error or HTML deficiency, contains
exactly the same text with the addition of extensive hypertext-based
cross-references.  <p>Get a <a
href="http://www.harlequin.com/education/books/HyperSpec/">copy</a>
(unless you have a lightning-fast internet link, that is, in which
case you can use the one at <a href="http://www.harlequin.com/">
Harlequin</a>).  It's invaluable.
 
<h2>Emacs</h2>

<p> I don't wish to start an editor flamewar, but if you don't use 
Emacs you won't get much out of this document.

<p> I've used FSF Emacs 19 and 20 and XEmacs 20 for Lisp.  All of them
play nice, so choose one based on your political sympathies; everyone
else has.  The only relevant technical difference is that version 5.8
of ILISP (see below) doesn't seem to produce pulldown menus when used
with XEmacs.  I can't remember key bindings, so I use FSF Emacs.

<h2>ILISP</h2>

<p> Currently at version 5.10.1.  This is a much better Lisp mode
than the default Emacs one, and can be found at <a
href="http://ilisp.cons.org/">http://ilisp.cons.org/</a>.  Xemacs also
bundles an older version, but the Xemacs people and the ILISP people
are presently talking to each other about getting this resolved.

<hr>
<h1><a name="getting_started">Getting Started</a></h1>

<h2>CMUCL</h2>

<p>Install the packages.  You almost certainly want at least
cmucl-defsystem-2.4.x and cmucl-2.4.x, plus your choice of core image
(-normal, -safe or -small); if you have a fast network link
you may well find a use for the rest of it too.  You don't need
hemlock if you have Emacs (possibly also vice versa, but I haven't
used it, I don't know).

<p>Run <tt>/usr/sbin/cmuclconfig</tt>.  To minimise time spent faffing
around at the beginning of a Lisp session, it's possible to dump extra
bits of code into a Lisp image so it starts up with them already
resident (it's probably also a win in paging terms, but I don't know).
This concept will be familiar to anyone who's watched Emacs build.
Anyway, this script allows you to select the bits you want for your
own custom `core' file.  I'd recommend that you include defsystem, at
least.  Once you have a core file you will need to put it somewhere
that Lisp can find it.  I usually just copy it over the top of the
original (I bet dpkg loves me); the alternative is to set the
environment variable <tt>$CMUCLLIB</tt> to whatever directory you did
put the core file in.

<h2>Emacs </h2>

<p>Unless your distribution is old or broken, it should have come with
an acceptable Emacs setup.  According to the FSSTND, Emacs will
install architecture-independent data files into
<tt>/usr/share/emacs/</tt><i>version</i><tt>/lisp</tt>.  If you aren't
already on familiar terms with Emacs at the elisp level, you might
well end up being by the time you've done any Lisp - you'll probably
find yourself living in the editor.  If you elected not to install the
<tt>*.el</tt> files the first time around, you might want to now.  If
space is a concern you can gzip them and have Emacs uncompress them
whenever you visit one - FSF Emacs has <tt>jka-compr</tt> and XEmacs
has <tt>toggle-auto-compression</tt> for this purpose

<h2>ILISP</h2>

<p>Assuming ILISP 5.9 or later, it installs fairly painlessly (read
the INSTALLATION file) unless you have an XEmacs with an older version
installed already.  It might install painlessly even if so, but I
haven't tried..

<p> Once you've done that, it comes with installation instructions,
which FSF Emacs users can follow and XEmacs users may have to
improvise around (as it's already installed).  My advice would be to
paste all/most of the <tt>ilisp.emacs</tt> file into your
<tt>.emacs</tt>, at least until you know what it does.  The segment
below is probably about the minimum necessary.

<pre>
(autoload 'run-ilisp "ilisp" "Select a new inferior LISP." t)
(autoload 'cmulisp   "ilisp" "Inferior CMU Common LISP." t)
(setq cmulisp-program "/usr/bin/lisp")
(setq cmulisp-local-source-directory "/usr/src/cmucl/cmucl/")
(set-default 'auto-mode-alist
             (append '(("\\.lisp$" . lisp-mode)) auto-mode-alist))
(add-hook 'lisp-mode-hook 
          '(lambda () 
             (require 'ilisp)
             (setq indent-tabs-mode nil)))

;;; the cmucl-specific stuff in ilisp runs after the hook defined
;;; above, and overrides the binary extension to be "sparcf", which is not
;;; what we want.  The hook below runs after that, so we can set it back
;;; again

(add-hook 'cmulisp-hook
	  (lambda ()
	    (setq ilisp-init-binary-extension "x86f")
	    (setq ilisp-init-binary-command "(progn \"x86f\")")
	    (setq ilisp-binary-extension "x86f")))
</pre>

<h2>Other elisp</h2>

<p>I don't intend to go into too much elisp detail here; this is
supposed to be about Common Lisp not Emacs.  But you may well find
yourself writing or acquiring small elisp functions here and there,
and needing a place to keep them.  Your options are: (1) paste them
all into your <tt>.emacs</tt>, or (2) create a directory somewhere,
add it to your <tt>load-path</tt> then save them each in their own
file (or according to some logical division, at any rate) and use
<tt>load</tt> (for straightforward Lisp) or <tt>require</tt> (for
things that include a <tt>provide</tt> form) to load them when needed.

<p> If you use XEmacs 20, you can put these files into
<tt>~/.xemacs/lisp</tt> and they will be found automatically.  FSF
Emacs users will need to create their own directory and add it to
theload path by hand : <tt>(setq load-path (append '("~/elisp")
load-path))</tt> in <tt>.emacs</tt> is an appropriate incantation.

<hr>
<h1><a name="using_it">Using it</a></h1>

<H2>See if it works</h2>

<p> Once everything is installed, you should be able to open Emacs,
type <tt>M-x cmulisp RET</tt> to start the environment, then visit
<tt>foo.lisp</tt>.  Type 

<pre>
(+ 1 2)
</pre>

and press <tt>M-C-x </tt> to have Lisp evaluate it.  The number '3'
should be displayed in the echo area (that's the bottom line in the
Emacs frame).  If it produces more than one line of output -- and that
example probably won't, unless it triggers a bout of garbage
collection -- Emacs will split the frame into two windows and display
the answer in the new one.  Thus:

<pre>
(format nil "One line~%Two lines")
</pre>

<tt>M-C-x</tt> that, and see it show the returned string.  Now <tt>C-c
1</tt> to make the output window go away.

<p>While you're here, try the various `documentation' keys.  Position
the cursor on 'format' and press 
<ul>
<li> <b>C-c a</b> to find out its argument list
<li> <b>C-c d</b> to show its builtin documentation
<li> <b>C-c H</b> to look up its HyperSpec entry (requires suitable
web browser)
</ul>

<h2>Debugging</h2>

<p> The first thing you need to know is how to get out of the
debugger.  To demonstrate this, we need to get into the debugger:

<pre>
* (/ 1 0)

Arithmetic error DIVISION-BY-ZERO signalled.
Operation was KERNEL::DIVISION, operands (1 0).

Restarts:
  0: [ABORT] Return to Top-Level.

Debug  (type H for help)

(KERNEL::INTEGER-/-INTEGER 1 0)
Source: Error finding source: 
Error in function DEBUG::GET-FILE-TOP-LEVEL-FORM:  Source file no longer exists:
  target:code/numbers.lisp.
0] 
</pre>

<p><tt>0] </tt> is the debugger prompt.  If you cause another error,
you could get <tt>0]]</tt> which means that you're in the debugger
twice.  You exit by typing <tt>q</tt> to abort everything and go back
to the top level, or the number of one of the listed restarts -
in this case there is only the one restart <tt>0</tt> which will abort
back to the toplevel anyway.

<p>(If you don't want a recursive debug session, you can use the
debugger command <tt>flush</tt> (or related variable
<tt>debug::*flush-debug-errors*</tt>) to toggle whether errors while
in the debugger are ignored or cause another level of debugger.  The
default setting is T (ignore errors) when running from the
command-line, NIL (recursive debug) when running with ILISP)

<p>If you are repeatedly evaluating a form with errors from a Lisp
source buffer, note that Emacs doesn't exit the debugger on its own,
but just carries on (conceptually, it's entering the subsequent forms
at the <tt>0]</tt> prompt).  This doesn't affect too much usually, but
does mean that 
<ul>
<li> eventually you will get a message like 
<pre>
Help! 11 nested errors.  KERNEL:*MAXIMUM-ERROR-DEPTH* exceeded
</pre>
(which you can probably ignore - it means that CMUCL has dropped back
to the <tt>*</tt> prompt on its own), 

<li> although the <tt>*cmulisp*</tt> buffer is still displaying
<tt>*</tt> as the prompt, you can type '<tt>backtrace</tt>' or other
debugger command into it to see what happened, 

<li> if you're doing something like rebinding <tt>*readtable*</tt>,
things can get quite exciting.  There is a change to CMUCL in
the works to optionally make it reset to the standard readtable when
using the debugger, so look out for that when it arrives.

</ul>
<p> For tracing the flow of execution of a program, the standard CL
macros TRACE and UNTRACE exist, and work like this
<pre>
* (defun fac (n) (if (> n 1) (* n (fac (1- n))) 1))
FAC
* (trace fac)
(FAC)
* (fac 3)
  0: (FAC 3)
    1: (FAC 2)
      2: (FAC 1)
      2: FAC returned 1
    1: FAC returned 2
  0: FAC returned 6
6
* 
</pre>

<p> Sometimes CMUCL refuses to trace compiled functions, complaining
about :function-end breakpoints.  I don't know why it does this.  The
simplest workaround is to redefine the fuction as interpreted - place
the cursor on the function definition in the source buffer and M-C-x.
Face it, you're now printing out two lines of text every time it gets
called, the speed slowdown from running the interpreted version is not
exactly going to be critical.

<p>[TBD: is there a flashy GUD-style debugger for Emacs?]

<h2>Logical pathnames</h2>

<P>There are many kinds of file system.  Common Lisp provides
facilities for referring to and manipulating files which minimize the
program-visible differences between them.

<p>As programmers we have the choice of representing filenames as
strings (<i>namestrings</i>), or as <i>pathnames</i>.
<i>Pathnames</i> are implementation-independent structured objects
with six components: a host, a device, a directory, a name, a type,
and a version.  The mapping onto the underlying filesystem(s) is
defined by the implementation: in CMUCL it is documented in section
2.13 of the User Manual

<pre>
* (make-pathname :directory "/etc" :name "inetd" :type "conf")
#p"//etc/inetd.conf"
</pre>

<p><i>Logical pathnames</i> effectively provide a `hook' into the
translation process for the programmer, so can be used to avoid
hardcoding non-portable paths into programs.  There is one caveat with
logical pathnames, however - their behaviour is defined only for
uppercase names (which on Unix will get translated to lowercase) so
require some degree of work if you want to refer to files with
uppercase in their names.

<pre>
* (setf (logical-pathname-translations "FOO")
    '(("**;*.*.*" "/full/path/to/foo/**/*.*.*")))
* (translate-logical-pathname (make-pathname :host "FOO" :directory "BAR" :name "BAZ" :type "LISP"))
#p"/full/path/to/foo/bar/baz.lisp"
</pre>

<p>The preferred way of maintaining these is to keep a file containing
the list of translations for <tt>FOO</tt> in
<tt>#p"library:FOO.translations"</tt> and use
<tt>load-logical-pathname-defaults</tt> when you need it.

<p><i>Namestrings</i> are defined for logical paths as well as for
physical ones - the standard read/print syntax for a namestring is
<tt>#p</tt> followed by the namestring representation.  <tt>#p</tt> is
a reader macro that creates a pathname object

<pre>
* (type-of #p"FOO:etc;inetd.conf")
LOGICAL-PATHNAME
</pre>

<p>As a convenience to the user, <tt>PARSE-NAMESTRING</tt> (which is
the thing that handles <tt>#p</tt> syntax) will uppercase its argument
when dealing with a logical pathname.  <tt>MAKE-PATHNAME</tt> might
not, however.  That is, it doesn't in CMUCL at present, but that will
probably change.

<H2>Creating a project</h2>

<p> <tt>defsystem</tt> is to Lisp as <tt>make</tt> is to C.  Which is
to say, 

<ul>
<li> thoroughly incomprehensible at first sight
<li> not standard, but incompatible versions are provided by most
vendors
</ul>

<p>CMUCL comes with a portable defsystem implementation (if you
installed it as recommended above, anyway), which originally came from
Mark Kantrowitz's ``<a
href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/ai-repository/ai/lang/lisp/code/tools/mkantdoc.tgz">Portable
Utilities for Common Lisp</a>''. 

<p>You can check that your Lisp has defsystem loaded by evaluating
<tt>*features*</tt> to see if it includes <tt>:MK-DEFSYSTEM</tt>
- if not, see the previous section.

<p>It actually turns out to be quite simple.  Your project is a
system, which has components.  It's defined in a file called
<i>projectname</i><tt>.system</tt> using the <tt>defsystem</tt> macro.
Once you have that, then you can do

<pre>
* (compile-system 'my-system)
</pre>
and/or
<pre>
* (load-system 'my-system)
</pre>

<p>Here's the <tt>my-system</tt> definition, for completeness
<pre>
(defsystem my-system
  :source-pathname "/home/dan/src/http-lisp/"
  :components ((:file "socket")
               (:file "daemon"))
  :depends-on nil)

<h3>defsystem and logical pathnames</h3>

<p> For the most part, defsystem requires relative pathnames.  Be
aware though that where it uses absolute names it doesn't get on too
well with logical pathnames.  My system definitions tend to contain
things like

<pre>
  :source-pathname #.(translate-logical-pathname #p"src:rinaldo;")
</pre>

to get around this.

<h2> Networking</h2>

<p> You have three options for IP networking:

<ol>
<li>The CMUCL manual (you have printed it out, haven't you?) talks
about the REMOTE and WIRE packages.  Personally I ignore both of these
in favour of 
<li>the functions in <tt>code/internet.lisp</tt> and
<tt>(system:make-fd-stream)</tt>.  For example,

<pre>
(let* ((socket (ext:connect-to-inet-socket "localhost" 80))
       (stream (system:make-fd-stream socket :input t :output t
                                      :buffering :none)))
  (format stream "HEAD / HTTP/1.0~%~%")
  (do ((l (read-line stream nil)  (read-line stream nil)))
      ((not l) nil)
    (format t "~S~%" l)))
       
"HTTP/1.1 200 OK^M"
"Date: Tue, 12 Jan 1999 01:40:20 GMT^M"
"Server: Apache/1.2.5^M"
"Last-Modified: Sun, 10 Jan 1999 14:46:12 GMT^M"
"ETag: \"48808-2b51-3698bd34\"^M"
"Content-Length: 11089^M"
"Accept-Ranges: bytes^M"
"Connection: close^M"
"Content-Type: text/html^M"
"^M"
NIL
</pre>

or more latterly <li><a
href="http://ww.telent.net/cliki/db-sockets">db-sockets</a> which has
a slightly more sane API and does rather more too (it also does UDP,
and has a consistent interface to socket options, and so on)
</ol>

<h2> OS interfaces</h2>

<p> The CMUCL User Guide is pretty good on this (mostly 
<a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~rtoy/software/cmu-user/node221.html#SECTION00900000000000000000">Chapter 8, Alien Objects</a>

 but also see 

<a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~rtoy/software/cmu-user/node28.html#SECTION00350000000000000000">2.5 Garbage Collection</a>

).  Fundamentally, you can call anything from Lisp that
you can call in C.  In practice, you might have to be careful for
anything that involves threads or signals, but read the user guide and
see how you get on.  A fairly straightforward example is in <a
href="pcre.lisp">pcre.lisp</a>, an interface to Philip Hazel's
Perl-Compatible Regular Expresion library.

<p>A neat feature which is said to be better than some of the
commercial CLs is the <b>finalize</b> function. This allows you to
allocate foreign objects and then forget about them. When they become
garbage the GC will call your function that knows how to free the
object.

<H2>Multithreading</h2>

<p> Multithreading in CMUCL is currently done with user-level threads,
although there is work in progress to take advantage of kernel
threads.  The code is in src/code/multi-proc.lisp, with an interface
"based roughly on the <a
href="http://www.harlequin.com/education/books/CLIM-2.0/GUID_333.HTM#HEADING333-0">CLIM-SYS</a>
spec. and support needed for <a
href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/iiip/doc/cl-http/home-page.html">cl-http</a>".

<p> You might want to try running
<pre>
* (setf mp::*idle-process* mp::*initial-process*)
* (mp::start-lisp-connection-listener :port 3456 :password "foobar")
</pre>

then you can get a listener by telnetting to localhost port 3456 and
supplying the password (<i>including</i> the quotes).

<h2> CORBA</h2>

<p>See <a href="http://ww.telent.net/cliki/CORBA"
>http://ww.telent.net/cliki/CORBA</a> for up-to-the-minute news.

<h2> Graphics interfaces</h2>

<p>There are a number of options here
<ul>

<li> CLX, CLUE, CLIO correspond roughly to Xlib, Xt and a widget set
respectively; you'd tend to use all of them at once.  The interface
defined by CLIO could be implemented with a look &amp; feel like Motif
or Xaw or Gtk etc - the implementation you actually get looks more
like OpenLook than anything else.  I understand that some people like
it ...

<li> Garnet has advanced constrainable objects and things.  Ugly
if you like the 3d motif/tk/gtk look, though.

<li> cl-gtk and CLM talk down a pipe to a program written in C that
knows <a href="http://ww.gtk.org/">Gtk</a> or Motif respectively.  CLM
is reported to also work with LessTif.  If you have it installed, try
<pre>
  * (load "library:subsystems/clm-library")
  * (load "library:subsystems/clx-library")
  * (/ 1 0)

</pre>
to see the Motif-based debugger...
</ul>

<p> The "One True Lisp" graphics interface is <a
href="http://www.harlequin.com/education/books/CLIM-2.0/">CLIM</a>.
People are working on <a
href="http://www.cons.org/free-clim/">free-clim</a>, but in the
meantime GARNET and CLIO/CLUE are probably the two options most worth
considering.

<p>For more timely information, and some other options, see

<h2>Documents on your local disk</h2>

<ul>
<li> Everything in <tt>/usr/doc/cmucl*</tt>, esp. the user manual.

<li> <tt>/usr/src/cmucl-2.4.x/src/docs/</tt>, if you installed the
source, has compiler internals documentation.  Word from the CMUCL
hackers is that they're "planning to re-organise" though, so it may or
may not be accurate.
</ul>

<h2>Web sites and online documents</h2>

<ul>

<li> <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/cltl2.html">
Common Lisp the Language, 2nd Edition</a>.  The first edition was once
the definition of Common Lisp.  The second is not.  On the other
hand, it's probably a bit more readable than the Hyperspec.

<li> ``Tutorial on Good Lisp Programming Style''; <a href=
"http://www.norvig.com/luv-slides.ps">slides</a> for the Lisp Users
and Vendors Conference, August 10, 1993

<li> Mark Kantrowitz's <a
href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/ai-repository/ai/lang/lisp/code/tools/mkantdoc.tgz">``Portable
Utilities for Common Lisp''</a> User Guide.  

<li> The <a
href="http://cvs2.cons.org:8000/cmucl/doc/EncyCMUCLopedia/">
EncyCMUCLopedia</a> - Paolo Amoroso's comprehensive collection of
every CMUCL-related document that he's been able to find.  It even
includes this one.

<li> Can I describe a newsgroup as an online document?  Whatever, be
sure to read <a href="news:comp.lang.lisp"><tt>comp.lang.lisp</tt></a>.  Be
sure not to post until you know what you're talking about.  It has one
of the highest signal/noise ratios of any unmoderated group I've seen
on Usenet, and I hesitate even to mention it because I want it to stay
that way.

<li> Most of the Lisp-related web sites also point to each other, so
there's not much point in listing them all here.  To get started, try
the <a href="http://www.elwoodcorp.com/alu/">Association of Lisp
Users</a>, and for all kinds of free software see <a
href="http://ww.telent.net/cliki/">CLiki</a>

</ul>

<h2>Books</h2>

<p>These are (some of) the CL books I bought, borrowed, or somehow
have access to.  The opinions expressed about them are mine alone;
please take them only for what they're worth (about 5p each, at last
valuation)

<uL>
<li> <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/onlisp/acl/">Paul
Graham; ANSI Common Lisp</a> is an introduction to ANSI CL, with a
language reference section at the back.  

<blockquote>Probably the most often recommended ANSI CL book for
beginners.  I haven't actually read it properly, but people whose
opinions I trust - including two of the early guinea pigs for this
document - like it, and on that basis I'd recommend it.</blockquote>

<li> By the same author, <a 
href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/onlisp/onlisp/"> On Lisp:
Advanced Techniques for Common Lisp</a> (Prentice Hall, ISBN
0-13-030552-9) is 80% devoted to macros (my first stop if I want to
know anything on that subject) and 20% to CLOS. 

<blockquote> ``Should be on the bookshelf of every CL programmer'' -
my copy isn't usually, as it tends to be open on my desk.  Excellent
book.</blockquote>

<li> <a href="http://www.norvig.com/paip.html">Peter Norvig; Paradigms
of Artificial Intelligence Programming</a> (Morgan Kaufmann, ISBN
1-55860-191-0).  It's not just about AI, as it also includes general
Lisp style and project management topics, such as use of packages,
error handling, robustness, common debugging situations, and system
definitions.  

<blockquote> Excellent.  Look at the comments at the location linked
above; they're all true.  This may be an opportune moment to plug the
rest of <a href="http://www.norvig.com/">Peter Norvig's web site</a>
too. </blockquote>

<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262610744">
Kiczales, des Rivi&egrave;res, Bobrow; The Art of the Metaobject
Protocol</a> (MIT Press, ISBN 0-262-61074-4).  The MOP is not part of
ANSI CL per se, but is included in many CLOS implementations
(including PCL as used in CMUCL).  It provides a way of observing and
changing the behaviour of the object system - the magic buzzwords
include `reflection' and `introspection'.  The book is illuminating
for explaining not only how the MOP is, but quite a lot of <i>why</i>
too.

<blockquote> Basically, this is the manual for the MOP, and if you
want to do metathings you're going to struggle without it.  

<p> Be aware however: it's not really intended as an introduction to
CLOS - if you aren't familiar with CLOS already you might prefer
something like "Object Oriented Programming in Common Lisp" by Sonya
Keene.  Disclaimer: I haven't tried it, but it's favourably thought of
on comp.lang.lisp and elsewhere
</blockquote>

<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201083191">
Winston &amp; Horn; LISP Third edition</a> (Addison Wesley, ISBN
0-201-08319-1).  Three parts: introduction to programming, `advanced
topics' and example programs.  I bought it because it was the only Lisp
book in Dillons (fortunately, Borders have now opened a shop near me).

<blockquote>I've not actually looked at it much since; I already can
program ...  If I sound lukewarm about this book, I probably am -
compare with ANSI Common Lisp or Norvig, and decide for yourself.
</blockquote>

</ul>

<p>I'm not suggesting that you need all of these; I have a real
struggle going past a computer bookstore without buying something, but
that doesn't mean you have to have.  If you want a second opinion, <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> have a reasonable <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/subst/categories/computer-science/what-is-lisp-article/002-1737507-6981456">summary</a>
of Lisp books.  Note that despite anything they say, `Common Lisp: the
Language' is <i>not</i> the official specification for ANSI CL: see
the HyperSpec instead.  Also, you may want to avoid buying it and use
the copy on the Web as listed above.
