The documentation is in
/usr/doc/cmucl
/usr/man/man1/cmucl.1
/usr/man/man1/lisp.1
/usr/info

I haven't included the Common Lisp HyperSpec (TM), from the
The Harlequin Group Limited. They have given permission 
to copy etc the files. It is a hypertext HTML reference
to ansi-common lisp. This is meant as a guide and in 
case of disputes the book is always right. I've included
the legal file here. (in README.hyperspec)

You should just untar the file in /usr/doc/cmucl/HyperSpec,
that's all. 

If you find errors in the docs (or in the program),
don't hesitate to email me. The better the documentation
and the tutorials, the more people will be rescued from
the horrors of C++. <grin>
