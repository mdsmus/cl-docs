<h1>CORBA in five minutes</h1>

<p><i>$Id: index.html,v 1.8 2000/05/03 23:52:14 dan Exp $</i> 
- still soliciting suggestions

<p><b>New:</b> See also <a href="gnome-lisp.html">CORBA, GNOME, CMUCL,
and other macabre tales</a>, if you're {man,woman,small furry thing
from Alpha Centauri} enough

<p> I've read far too many unhelpful guides to CORBA.  If I see
another explanation of why it's cool because it means you don't need
to understand anything, or what network transparency is, or any more
meaningless block diagrams depicting an ORB and a skeleton and some
stubs, I will do Something Bad.

<p> These are my notes on how I believe it really works.  Caveat: I don't
<i>know</i> either.  If I did, I'd probably write stultifyingly dull
incomprehensible stuff just like all the people that do.  Note also
that wherever I've said "X happens" there are probably a billion other
things that could possibly happen according to the standard.  OMG
standards are defined before being widely implemented, though, so
whether people are actually <i>doing</i> any of these billion other
things is another matter.  The cynical would substitute "instead of"
for "before" in the preceding sentence.

<div class=orbit>
<p>My ongoing CORBA experiments are mostly related to calling GNOME
from Lisp, because that's what I want to be able to do.  Paragraphs in
green - like this one - relate to implementational things to do with
CLORB, or ORBit, or GNOME, or GNU/Linux, and may not apply in other
circumstances
</p></div>

<h2> IIOP</h2>

<p> We're talking about a network protocol.  GIOP is the general
protocol, and IIOP is the IP version.  It runs over TCP.

<p> CORBA servers are programs with an OA (Object Adaptor) linked into
them.  This is a library that listens to the network for you.  CORBA
clients are programs that know how to talk IIOP: typically they do
this by having an ORB (Object Request Broker) and stubs linked into
them - as a CORBA application user, you call the stub.

<div class=orbit>
<p> A patch is available for tcpdump to decode the IIOP wire protocol 
- look in the <tt>patches</tt> directory of the ORBit distribution.
<a href="http://ethereal.zing.org">ethereal</a> also knows how 
to show them.
</p>
<p>Some ORBit installations come set up to use Unix-domain sockets
instead of TCP.  I don't know how you get anything else to talk on a
unix socket, but you can make it revert to TCP by editing <tt>/etc/orbitrc</tt>
in the obvious fashion.
</p>
</div>

<h2> IDL</h2>

<p>The calls that you can make of a server are described in IDL
(Interface Description Language).  All the guides go into extensive
detail about what IDL is, so I won't.  It lets you define interfaces
(objects with attributes and operations, but no specification of the
object implementation), compound types, exceptions, and a few other
bits.  It looks like C++ or Java inasmuch as it has lots of curly
braces.

<p> CORBA implementations will typically come with IDL compilers -
programs that take an IDL file and generate glue code (stubs and
skeletons for client and server respectively) so that you can
make/receive these calls using syntax that looks like a method call of
an object native to your language.  Obviously this will vary according
to your choice of implementation language: the OMG have standardised
the translations from IDL to most common languages, so that your C++
CORBA client can work with many different ORBs, if relinked against
the appropriate stubs for each of them.</p>

<p> Implementations are permitted to short-circuit bits of this
process if they think you'll not notice.  So if you write a C server
and client and IDL that describes the interface between them, a CORBA
implementation could legitimately stick the two together in the same
memory image and not go anywhere near the network.  I mention this
because everyone seems to think it's really great - but I won't go
into it because, basically, what's the point?  If you're going to
write everything in the same language, all the fun goes away.

<h2>IOR</h2>

<p> So that's the interface, now how do we find the implementation?
In a normal network protocol, we'd use something like a hostname/port,
or a host address/port, or one of those new-fangled URL things.  CORBA
has a concept of an IOR (Interoperable Object Reference), which is
basically the same thing fed through something that looks like Base64
encoding - but can't actually possibly be anywhere near as
information-dense, because a typical one is about 200 bytes long.
Luckily it doesn't matter that these things are basically opaque,
because CORBA is entirely wondrous and never goes wrong.  Because
you're likewise infallible, it will never ever happen that you kill
and restart a server process and fall to wondering whether your
stringified IOR is a reference to the old or the new one

<pre>
IOR:010400002800000049444c3a6f6d672e6f72672f436f734e616d696e672f4e616d696e67436f6e746578743a312e300001000000000000002c0000000101000014000000746e696e6b7061642e74656c656e742e6e6574004f060000080000000000000001000000
</pre>

<p><i>An IOR</i></p>

<p> Suppose you have an object which can be talked to using IIOP.  Its
IOR encodes - among other things, like protocol version numbers - the
hostname and port to which you can send IIOP messages that make that
object do things, and an opaque <tt>object_key</tt>, which
distinguishes different objects so you can have a single process serve
them all

<p> If you're a half-decent unix programmer you're probably asking how
it deals with access control.  Security is an issue, and as far as I
can determine, not one for which any widely implemented standards are
available.  So, firewall it.  

<p> There is a lovely wonderful standard for how you get these
unwieldy monsters from place to place, and it's so easy to use that
all the sample programs in the "intro to CORBA" guides don't - instead
they just have their servers print them to stdout or a file, and the
clients read them back.

<h2>CosNaming</h2>

<p>CosNaming is that service.  Or, to be more accurate, the
omg.org.CosNaming IDL module describes the interface to such a
service.  You still need - spot the bootstrapping issue - an IOR for an
implementation of CosNaming, but allegedly that's fairly standard.

<p>When you write a server, you need to call your CosNaming object to
register the server against a given name.  Then when you write a
client, you can look at the name server to find out where to send
messages.  Note that this means that both your client and server have
to be looking at the same name server.

<p>In traditional CORBA terms, the naming service for your ORB is in
the list of initial services.  So you get an ORB object using
<tt>CORBA_ORB_init</tt> (this is a function call in your language
bindings, not a CORBA call itself) then call
<tt>resolve_initial_reference("NameService")</tt> on it.

<div class=orbit>
<p>In ORBit terms, that apparently doesn't work yet.  The name server
is provided by a program called <tt>orbit-name-server</tt>, and you
can get its IOR by starting it and seeing what it prints.  Unless,
that is, you're expecting to interoperate with GNOME.  If you have all
the GNOME stuff running (I think that the panel is the necessary bit,
but I have the whole works started from gdm, so don't expect me to
know) there will be a process called <tt>gnome-name-service</tt>
already running, and you can get its IOR from an X property:

<pre>
$ xprop -root | grep GNOME_NAME  # find the window id
GNOME_NAME_SERVER(WINDOW): window id # 0x1800001
$ xprop -id 0x1800001 | grep IOR # query that window for the IOR    
GNOME_NAME_SERVER_IOR(STRING) = "IOR:016a17402800000049444c3a6f6d672e6f72672f436f734e616d696e672f4e616d696e67436f6e746578743a312e300001000000000000002c0000000101000014000000746e696e6b7061642e74656c656e742e6e6574005a050000080000000000000001000000"
</pre>

<p>Don't expect this to work immediately: Gnome also uses a
Principal-based security system which basically involves passing a
cookie (also available as an X property, or as
<tt>/tmp/orbit-<i>username</i>/cookie</tt>) along with all your
requests.  More on this in <a href="gnome-lisp.html">gnome-lisp.html</a>
if you can cope with the implementation language.

</div>

<h2>DII and DSI</h2>

<p> DII is a more `dynamic' way to invoke a CORBA request: instead of
being stuck with a stub which by its nature can only represent things
that were known at compile time, you can programmatically assemble all
your arguments at runtime.  DSI is the reverse operation for servers.

<p> Your stubs and skeletons could legitimately be implemented using
D[SI]I, or then again they might not be.  Unless you like writing
interpreters, there's probably not that much else interesting to say
about this,

<h2>IR</h2>

<p> IR here stands for Interface Repository.  It could potentially
also stand for Implementation Repository, but here we're concentrating
on things which are actually used, so we'll stick with interfaces.

<p> An IR is a bunch of objects which describe the interfaces of other
objects.  The classes used have names like InterfaceDef, OperationDef
and ModuleDef: the containment graph looks pretty similar to an IDL
file describing the same interface.

<p> Unfortunately, information doesn't magically filter into an IR:
somebody has to put it there manually.  A nice IR would be one that
started up with the knowledge of where to find vast amounts of IDL
file and read them in on the fly when asked for them; I haven't seen
it yet.

<div class=orbit>
<p>Some ORBs come with a program that takes an IDL file and creates IR
objects from it.  ORBit has only even <i>had</i> an IR for about one
released version and doesn't yet have such luxuries.  In fact, as of
0.5.0 the IR (<tt>orbit-ird</tt>) isn't finished anyway.  The CVS
version is a lot further on but still has issues.
</p>

<p>It's also a scarily opaque thing: you put data in and you're never
quite sure what happened to it.  Two tips: (a) check the return
values; it will often fail and return <tt>NULL</tt> without raising an
exception, (b) start it with <tt>-ORBDebugLevel=255 -ORBDebugModules=16</tt>
and keep an eye on stderr.

<p>Another random note about the state of ORBit that doesn't fit here
but doesn't fit anywhere else either: it doesn't support the
<tt>_interface</tt> attribute on Object.  This has recently caused me
some pain.

<p>In the meantime if you want a reliable IR there's nothing stopping
you using someone else's.  MICO is libre; ORBacus (formerly
OmniBroker) is gratis.  MICO apparently comes with a graphical IR
browser, but I haven't found it yet - also, you need to hack the
source and rebuild if you want to find out the IR's IOR.  ORBacus
comes with <tt>irfeed</tt>, one of the aforementioned "put this IDL
file in the IR, thanks" programs.  Both come with programs called
<tt>idl</tt>, which is a bit poor IMO.

<h2>Coming soon</h2>

<p>Object activation

<p>More links.  Better links.

<h2>Where next</h2>

<ul>
<li>Language mappings and the core CORBA/IIOP definition are available
on the <a href="http://www.omg.org">OMG</a> site.  The full thing is
pretty daunting: I settled for printing the C and Common Lisp
mappings, and the IR chapter of the core spec.  I'll do the rest when
i understand what I've got

<li>Mathieu Lacage and Dirk-Jan C Minnema have put together a document
entitled "GNOME &amp; CORBA", which you should be able to find
somewhere at <a
href="http://developer.gnome.org">developer.gnome.org</a> Apart from
the pointless block diagram, the rest of this is actually very useful.
Read it.

<li>Download and build all the ORBs you can find and attempt to stop
them all from trashing each others' include files.  Get the
development version of ORBit from GNOME CVS and spend an afternoon
swearing at its popt dependency.
