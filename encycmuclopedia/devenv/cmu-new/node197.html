There are two general kinds of timing information provided by the
<tt>time</tt> macro and other profiling utilities: real time and run
time.  Real time is elapsed, wall clock time.  It will be affected in
a fairly obvious way by any other activity on the machine.  The more
other processes contending for CPU and memory, the more real time will
increase.  This means that real time measurements are difficult to
replicate, though this is less true on a dedicated workstation.  The
advantage of real time is that it is real.  It tells you really how
long the program took to run under the benchmarking conditions.  The
problem is that you don't know exactly what those conditions were.
<P>
Run time is the amount of time that the processor supposedly spent
running the program, as opposed to waiting for I/O or running other
processes.  ``User run time'' and ``system run time'' are numbers
reported by the Unix kernel.  They are supposed to be a measure of how
much time the processor spent running your ``user'' program (which
will include GC overhead, etc.), and the amount of time that the
kernel spent running ``on your behalf.''
<P>
Ideally, user time should be totally unaffected by benchmarking
conditions; in reality user time does depend on other system activity,
though in rather non-obvious ways.
<P>
System time will clearly depend on benchmarking conditions.  In Lisp
benchmarking, paging activity increases system run time (but not by as much
as it increases real time, since the kernel spends some time waiting for
the disk, and this is not run time, kernel or otherwise.)
<P>
In my experience, the biggest trap in interpreting kernel/user run time is
to look only at user time.  In reality, it seems that the <i>sum</i> of kernel
and user time is more reproducible.  The problem is that as system activity
increases, there is a spurious <i>decrease</i> in user run time.  In effect, as
paging, etc., increases, user time leaks into system time.
<P>
So, in practice, the only way to get truly reproducible results is to run
with the same competing activity on the system.  Try to run on a machine
with nobody else logged in, and check with ``ps aux'' to see if there are any
system processes munching large amounts of CPU or memory.  If the ratio
between real time and the sum of user and system time varies much between
runs, then you have a problem.
