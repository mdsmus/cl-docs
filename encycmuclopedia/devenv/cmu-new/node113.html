<P>
Common Lisp has a very powerful type system, but conventional Common Lisp
implementations typically only recognize the small set of types
special in that implementation.  In these systems, there is an
unfortunate paradox: a declaration for a relatively general type like
<tt>fixnum</tt> will be recognized by the compiler, but a highly
specific declaration such as <tt>(integer 3 17)</tt> is totally
ignored.
<P>
This is obviously a problem, since the user has to know how to specify
the type of an object in the way the compiler wants it.  A very
minimal (but rarely satisfied) criterion for type system support is
that it be no worse to make a specific declaration than to make a
general one.  Python goes beyond this by exploiting a number of
advantages obtained from detailed type information.
<P>
Using more restrictive types in declarations allows the compiler to do
better type inference and more compile-time type checking.  Also, when
type declarations are considered to be consistency assertions that
should be verified (conditional on policy), then complex types are
useful for making more detailed assertions.
<P>
Python ``understands'' the list-style <tt>or</tt>, <tt>member</tt>,
<tt>function</tt>, array and number type specifiers.  Understanding
means that:
<UL>
<LI> If the type contains more information than is used in a
  particular context, then the extra information is simply ignored,
  rather than derailing type inference.
<LI> In many contexts, the extra information from these type
  specifier is used to good effect.  In particular, type checking in
  <tt>Python</tt> is <i>precise</i>, so these complex types can be used
  in declarations to make interesting assertions about functions and
  data structures (see section&nbsp;<A HREF="node98.html#precisetypechecks">4.5.2</A>.)  More specific
  declarations also aid type inference and reduce the cost for type
  checking.
</UL>
<P>
For related information, see section&nbsp;<A HREF="node167.html#numerictypes">5.11</A> for numeric types, and
section <A HREF="node163.html#arraytypes">5.10.3</A> for array types.
