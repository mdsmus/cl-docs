Hi,

I just wanted to know if my installation of cmucl 18c under redhat 7.0
has any hidden problems.
It just seems too easy. All that I heard referenced to on this form was
painful sounding installs using
Dabein packages etc. If it really is this easy, why isn't it talked
about more? I'm sure that more people
would use cmucl if this is all that there is to it. All that I did to
install it was (done as "root" of course):

1. Download the tarballs for cmucl-18c that use glib21. This included
the basic, extras, docs and
source. (The source really isn't needed but I found that, that is where
the good version of the xlib
demo program "menu.lisp" is.) (Actually the docs aren't needed either
but they are nice to have. I also
use this doc directory to keep the CMU encyclopedia etc. downloaded from

other sites.)

2. Expand the tarballs in /usr/local/lib/cmucl-18c/
The "doc" tarball needed to be expanded into a "doc" sub directory, all
of the others created their own
sub directories.

3. Copy the "sample-wrapper" that you will find in ../cmucl-18c/bin/
to /usr/local/bin and rename it what ever name you want to call lisp.
This directory is in the standard path so
linux will find it here. Edit this file and change the
"/<<your-cmucl-path>>/"
at the two locations to "/usr/local/lib/cmucl-18c/". In other words
Change:
   CMUCLLIB=/<<your-cmucl-path>>/lib
To:
CMUCLLIB=/usr/local/lib/cmucl-18c/lib
And Change:
   exec /<<your-cmucl-path>>/bin/lisp "$@"
To:
   exec /usr/local/lib/cmucl-18c/bin/lisp "$@"
I've haven't done anything with the entry that talks about a temp file.
Exactly when would this be used and
what would be the best way to set this up in Linux? All of this would be

easy to change later so don't sweat it.

4. Change directory to /usr/local/lib/cmucl-18c/lib and run ./config
I enabled everything except "motif and graphical debugger" since Motif
(lesstif) is not part of Red Hat's standard
installation. This creates a new lisp.core with these configurations and

it made a backup of the original. (It is good
to make a copy first that is explicitly labeled as the original version
that has the safest configuration.)

This is all that it took. If it is really this simple why didn't anyone
tell me sooner? I've run small programs and
had no problems yet.

Actually my install is a little more complicated but it works installed
like I said. On my system I named
the sample-wrapper cmucl-18c and made soft links for it called "cmucl"
and "lisp" so I can call it multiple ways.
This is one advantage of this type of install, if you have other lisps
which all want to be called "lisp" you can
just rename the wrapper. I also have a soft link for the "cmucl-18c"
directory just called "cmucl". I originally got
this from a statement about how a cmu system was set up (using
/usr/local/lib/cmucl/) but I don't know if it is
important.
