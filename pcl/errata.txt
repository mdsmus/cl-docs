** Extaneous COMBINE-RESULTS in TETS-ARITHMETIC

    (deftest test-arithmetic ()
      (combine-results
       (test-+)
       (test-*)))

should be:

    (deftest test-arithmetic ()
      (test-+)
      (test-*))

and the results will then be:

** Possible problem with PROBE-FILE and EXT:PROBE-DIRECTORY in CLISP on Windows

In CLISP 2.33.2 on Windows PROBE-FILE and EXT:PROBE-DIRECTORY don't
behave like they does on Unix--they only signals an error if the
pathname structure doesn't match the expected type (file or
directory). (Or something, Original reader sent a clarification. And
apparently CL-FAD handles this right so should check that.)

** Wrong error message in FILE-EXIST-P

Error case in definition of file-exist-p says "list-directory not
implemented" rather than "file-exist-p not implemented". (fixed on
web)

** ID3-P function should specify stream type

The function definition:

    (defun id3-p (file)
      (with-open-file (in file)
        (string= "ID3" (read-value 'iso-8859-1-string in :length 3))))

should specify the stream with :element-type '(unsigned-byte 8) as
follows:

    (defun id3-p (file)
      (with-open-file (in file :element-type '(unsigned-byte 8))
        (string= "ID3" (read-value 'iso-8859-1-string in :length 3))))

[Fixed in online version 2005-04-07]

** encoded-string-length doesn't account for byte-order-mark

The function:

    (defun encoded-string-length (string encoding terminated)
      (let ((characters (+ (length string) (if terminated 1 0))))
        (* characters (ecase encoding (0 1) (1 2)))))

needs to account for the byte order mark if the UCS-2
encoding is used.

** *id3-v1-genres*

Due to overzealous copyediting, in the DEFPARAMETER of *id3-v1-genres*
"Psychedelic" is spelled correctly while in the spec
it is mis-spelled "Psychadelic" Similarly, the genre "Humor" should be
"Humour".

* Chapter 30

**  &lt and &gt should be &lt; and &gt;
