Beyond Lists: Other Uses for Cons Cells</H1><P>As you saw in the previous chapter, the list data type is an illusion
created by a set of functions that manipulate cons cells. Common Lisp
also provides functions that let you treat data structures built out
of cons cells as trees, sets, and lookup tables. In this chapter I'll
give you a quick tour of some of these other data structures and the
functions for manipulating them. As with the list-manipulation
functions, many of these functions will be useful when you start
writing more complicated macros and need to manipulate Lisp code as
data.</P><A NAME="trees"><H2>Trees</H2></A><P>Treating structures built from cons cells as trees is just about as
natural as treating them as lists. What is a list of lists, after
all, but another way of thinking of a tree? The difference between a
function that treats a bunch of cons cells as a list and a function
that treats the same bunch of cons cells as a tree has to do with
which cons cells the functions traverse to find the values of the
list or tree. The cons cells traversed by a list function, called the
<I>list structure</I>, are found by starting at the first cons cell and
following <CODE><B>CDR</B></CODE> references until reaching a <CODE><B>NIL</B></CODE>. The elements
of the list are the objects referenced by the <CODE><B>CAR</B></CODE>s of the cons
cells in the list structure. If a cons cell in the list structure has
a <CODE><B>CAR</B></CODE> that references another cons cell, the referenced cons
cell is considered to be the head of a list that's an element of the
outer list.<SUP>1</SUP> <I>Tree structure</I>, on the other hand, is traversed by
following both <CODE><B>CAR</B></CODE> and <CODE><B>CDR</B></CODE> references for as long as they
point to other cons cells. The values in a tree are thus the
atomic--non-cons-cell-values referenced by either the <CODE><B>CAR</B></CODE>s or
the <CODE><B>CDR</B></CODE>s of the cons cells in the tree structure.</P><P>For instance, the following box-and-arrow diagram shows the cons
cells that make up the list of lists: <CODE>((1 2) (3 4) (5 6))</CODE>. The
list structure includes only the three cons cells inside the dashed
box while the tree structure includes all the cons cells. </P><P><IMG CLASS="figure" SRC="figures/list-or-tree.png"/></P><P>To see the difference between a list function and a tree function,
you can consider how the functions <CODE><B>COPY-LIST</B></CODE> and <CODE><B>COPY-TREE</B></CODE>
will copy this bunch of cons cells. <CODE><B>COPY-LIST</B></CODE>, as a list
function, copies the cons cells that make up the list structure. That
is, it makes a new cons cell corresponding to each of the cons cells
inside the dashed box. The <CODE><B>CAR</B></CODE>s of each of these new cons cells
reference the same object as the <CODE><B>CAR</B></CODE>s of the original cons cells
in the list structure. Thus, <CODE><B>COPY-LIST</B></CODE> doesn't copy the sublists
<CODE>(1 2)</CODE>, <CODE>(3 4)</CODE>, or <CODE>(5 6)</CODE>, as shown in this
diagram:</P><P><IMG CLASS="figure" SRC="figures/copy-list-list-or-tree.png"/></P><P><CODE><B>COPY-TREE</B></CODE>, on the other hand, makes a new cons cell for each of
the cons cells in the diagram and links them together in the same
structure, as shown in this diagram:</P><P><IMG CLASS="figure" SRC="figures/copy-tree-list-or-tree.png"/></P><P>Where a cons cell in the original referenced an atomic value, the
corresponding cons cell in the copy will reference the same value.
Thus, the only objects referenced in common by the original tree and
the copy produced by <CODE><B>COPY-TREE</B></CODE> are the numbers 5, 6, and the
symbol <CODE><B>NIL</B></CODE>.</P><P>Another function that walks both the <CODE><B>CAR</B></CODE>s and the <CODE><B>CDR</B></CODE>s of a
tree of cons cells is <CODE><B>TREE-EQUAL</B></CODE>, which compares two trees,
considering them equal if the tree structure is the same shape and if
the leaves are <CODE><B>EQL</B></CODE> (or if they satisfy the test supplied with
the <CODE>:test</CODE> keyword argument).</P><P>Some other tree-centric functions are the tree analogs to the
<CODE><B>SUBSTITUTE</B></CODE> and <CODE><B>NSUBSTITUTE</B></CODE> sequence functions and their
<CODE>-IF</CODE> and <CODE>-IF-NOT</CODE> variants. The function <CODE><B>SUBST</B></CODE>, like
<CODE><B>SUBSTITUTE</B></CODE>, takes a new item, an old item, and a tree (as
opposed to a sequence), along with <CODE>:key</CODE> and <CODE>:test</CODE>
keyword arguments, and it returns a new tree with the same shape as
the original tree but with all instances of the old item replaced
with the new item. For example: </P><PRE>CL-USER&gt; (subst 10 1 '(1 2 (3 2 1) ((1 1) (2 2))))
(10 2 (3 2 10) ((10 10) (2 2)))</PRE><P><CODE><B>SUBST-IF</B></CODE> is analogous to <CODE><B>SUBSTITUTE-IF</B></CODE>. Instead of an old
item, it takes a one-argument function--the function is called with
each atomic value in the tree, and whenever it returns true, the
position in the new tree is filled with the new value.
<CODE><B>SUBST-IF-NOT</B></CODE> is the same except the values where the test
returns <CODE><B>NIL</B></CODE> are replaced. <CODE><B>NSUBST</B></CODE>, <CODE><B>NSUBST-IF</B></CODE>, and
<CODE><B>NSUBST-IF-NOT</B></CODE> are the recycling versions of the <CODE><B>SUBST</B></CODE>
functions. As with most other recycling functions, you should use
these functions only as drop-in replacements for their nondestructive
counterparts in situations where you know there's no danger of
modifying a shared structure. In particular, you must continue to
save the return value of these functions since you have no guarantee
that the result will be <CODE><B>EQ</B></CODE> to the original tree.<SUP>2</SUP> </P><A NAME="sets"><H2>Sets</H2></A><P>Sets can also be implemented in terms of cons cells. In fact, you can
treat any list as a set--Common Lisp provides several functions for
performing set-theoretic operations on lists. However, you should
bear in mind that because of the way lists are structured, these
operations get less and less efficient the bigger the sets get.</P><P>That said, using the built-in set functions makes it easy to write
set-manipulation code. And for small sets they may well be more
efficient than the alternatives. If profiling shows you that these
functions are a performance bottleneck in your code, you can always
replace the lists with sets built on top of hash tables or bit
vectors.</P><P>To build up a set, you can use the function <CODE><B>ADJOIN</B></CODE>. <CODE><B>ADJOIN</B></CODE>
takes an item and a list representing a set and returns a list
representing the set containing the item and all the items in the
original set. To determine whether the item is present, it must scan
the list; if the item isn't found, <CODE><B>ADJOIN</B></CODE> creates a new cons
cell holding the item and pointing to the original list and returns
it. Otherwise, it returns the original list.</P><P><CODE><B>ADJOIN</B></CODE> also takes <CODE>:key</CODE> and <CODE>:test</CODE> keyword
arguments, which are used when determining whether the item is
present in the original list. Like <CODE><B>CONS</B></CODE>, <CODE><B>ADJOIN</B></CODE> has no
effect on the original list--if you want to modify a particular list,
you need to assign the value returned by <CODE><B>ADJOIN</B></CODE> to the place
where the list came from. The modify macro <CODE><B>PUSHNEW</B></CODE> does this for
you automatically. </P><PRE>CL-USER&gt; (defparameter *set* ())

the related functions <CODE><B>MEMBER-IF</B></CODE> and <CODE><B>MEMBER-IF-NOT</B></CODE>. These
functions are similar to the sequence functions <CODE><B>FIND</B></CODE>,
<CODE><B>FIND-IF</B></CODE>, and <CODE><B>FIND-IF-NOT</B></CODE> except they can be used only with
lists. And instead of returning the item when it's present, they
return the cons cell containing the item--in other words, the sublist
starting with the desired item. When the desired item isn't present
in the list, all three functions return <CODE><B>NIL</B></CODE>.</P><P>The remaining set-theoretic functions provide bulk operations:
<CODE><B>INTERSECTION</B></CODE>, <CODE><B>UNION</B></CODE>, <CODE><B>SET-DIFFERENCE</B></CODE>, and
<CODE><B>SET-EXCLUSIVE-OR</B></CODE>. Each of these functions takes two lists and
<CODE>:key</CODE> and <CODE>:test</CODE> keyword arguments and returns a new list
representing the set resulting from performing the appropriate
set-theoretic operation on the two lists: <CODE><B>INTERSECTION</B></CODE> returns a
list containing all the elements found in both arguments. <CODE><B>UNION</B></CODE>
returns a list containing one instance of each unique element from
the two arguments.<SUP>3</SUP> <CODE><B>SET-DIFFERENCE</B></CODE> returns a list
containing all the elements from the first argument that don't appear
in the second argument. And <CODE><B>SET-EXCLUSIVE-OR</B></CODE> returns a list
containing those elements appearing in only one or the other of the
two argument lists but not in both. Each of these functions also has
a recycling counterpart whose name is the same except with an <I>N</I>
prefix.</P><P>Finally, the function <CODE><B>SUBSETP</B></CODE> takes two lists and the usual
<CODE>:key</CODE> and <CODE>:test</CODE> keyword arguments and returns true if
the first list is a subset of the second--if every element in the
first list is also present in the second list. The order of the
elements in the lists doesn't matter. </P><PRE>CL-USER&gt; (subsetp '(3 2 1) '(1 2 3 4))

NIL</PRE><A NAME="lookup-tables-alists-and-plists"><H2>Lookup Tables: Alists and Plists</H2></A><P>In addition to trees and sets, you can build tables that map keys to
values out of cons cells. Two flavors of cons-based lookup tables are
commonly used, both of which I've mentioned in passing in previous
chapters. They're <I>association lists</I>, also called <I>alists</I>, and
<I>property lists</I>, also known as <I>plists</I>. While you wouldn't use
either alists or plists for large tables--for that you'd use a hash
table--it's worth knowing how to work with them both because for
small tables they can be more efficient than hash tables and because
they have some useful properties of their own.</P><P>An alist is a data structure that maps keys to values and also
supports reverse lookups, finding the key when given a value. Alists
also support adding key/value mappings that shadow existing mappings
in such a way that the shadowing mapping can later be removed and the
original mappings exposed again.</P><P>Under the covers, an alist is essentially a list whose elements are
themselves cons cells. Each element can be thought of as a key/value
pair with the key in the cons cell's <CODE><B>CAR</B></CODE> and the value in the
<CODE><B>CDR</B></CODE>. For instance, the following is a box-and-arrow diagram of
an alist mapping the symbol <CODE>A</CODE> to the number 1, <CODE>B</CODE> to 2,
and <CODE>C</CODE> to 3:</P><P><IMG CLASS="figure" SRC="figures/alist-abc-123.png"/></P><P>Unless the value in the <CODE><B>CDR</B></CODE> is a list, cons cells representing
the key/value pairs will be <I>dotted pairs</I> in s-expression
notation. The alist diagramed in the previous figure, for instance,
is printed like this: </P><PRE>((A . 1) (B . 2) (C . 3))</PRE><P>The main lookup function for alists is <CODE><B>ASSOC</B></CODE>, which takes a key
and an alist and returns the first cons cell whose <CODE><B>CAR</B></CODE> matches
the key or <CODE><B>NIL</B></CODE> if no match is found.</P><PRE>CL-USER&gt; (assoc 'a '((a . 1) (b . 2) (c . 3)))

(C . 3)
CL-USER&gt; (assoc 'd '((a . 1) (b . 2) (c . 3)))
NIL</PRE><P>To get the value corresponding to a given key, you simply pass the
result of <CODE><B>ASSOC</B></CODE> to <CODE><B>CDR</B></CODE>.</P><PRE>CL-USER&gt; (cdr (assoc 'a '((a . 1) (b . 2) (c . 3))))
1</PRE><P>By default the key given is compared to the keys in the alist using
<CODE><B>EQL</B></CODE>, but you can change that with the standard combination of
<CODE>:key</CODE> and <CODE>:test</CODE> keyword arguments. For instance, if you
wanted to use string keys, you might write this:</P><PRE>CL-USER&gt; (assoc &quot;a&quot; '((&quot;a&quot; . 1) (&quot;b&quot; . 2) (&quot;c&quot; . 3)) :test #'string=)
(&quot;a&quot; . 1)</PRE><P>Without specifying <CODE>:test</CODE> to be <CODE><B>STRING=</B></CODE>, that <CODE><B>ASSOC</B></CODE>
would probably return <CODE><B>NIL</B></CODE> because two strings with the same
contents aren't necessarily <CODE><B>EQL</B></CODE>. </P><PRE>CL-USER&gt; (assoc &quot;a&quot; '((&quot;a&quot; . 1) (&quot;b&quot; . 2) (&quot;c&quot; . 3)))
NIL</PRE><P>Because <CODE><B>ASSOC</B></CODE> searches the list by scanning from the front of
the list, one key/value pair in an alist can shadow other pairs with
the same key later in the list.</P><PRE>CL-USER&gt; (assoc 'a '((a . 10) (a . 1) (b . 2) (c . 3)))
(A . 10)</PRE><P>You can add a pair to the front of an alist with <CODE><B>CONS</B></CODE> like this:</P><PRE>(cons (cons 'new-key 'new-value) alist)</PRE><P>However, as a convenience, Common Lisp provides the function
<CODE><B>ACONS</B></CODE>, which lets you write this:</P><PRE>(acons 'new-key 'new-value alist)</PRE><P>Like <CODE><B>CONS</B></CODE>, <CODE><B>ACONS</B></CODE> is a function and thus can't modify the
place holding the alist it's passed. If you want to modify an alist,
you need to write either this:</P><PRE>(setf alist (acons 'new-key 'new-value alist))</PRE><P>or this:</P><PRE>(push (cons 'new-key 'new-value) alist)</PRE><P>Obviously, the time it takes to search an alist with <CODE><B>ASSOC</B></CODE> is a
function of how deep in the list the matching pair is found. In the
worst case, determining that no pair matches requires <CODE><B>ASSOC</B></CODE> to
scan every element of the alist. However, since the basic mechanism
for alists is so lightweight, for small tables an alist can
outperform a hash table. Also, alists give you more flexibility in
how you do the lookup. I already mentioned that <CODE><B>ASSOC</B></CODE> takes
<CODE>:key</CODE> and <CODE>:test</CODE> keyword arguments. When those don't suit
your needs, you may be able to use the <CODE><B>ASSOC-IF</B></CODE> and
<CODE><B>ASSOC-IF-NOT</B></CODE> functions, which return the first key/value pair
whose <CODE><B>CAR</B></CODE> satisfies (or not, in the case of <CODE><B>ASSOC-IF-NOT</B></CODE>)
the test function passed in the place of a specific item. And three
functions--<CODE><B>RASSOC</B></CODE>, <CODE><B>RASSOC-IF</B></CODE>, and <CODE><B>RASSOC-IF-NOT</B></CODE>--work
just like the corresponding <CODE><B>ASSOC</B></CODE> functions except they use the
value in the <CODE><B>CDR</B></CODE> of each element as the key, performing a
reverse lookup. </P><P>The function <CODE><B>COPY-ALIST</B></CODE> is similar to <CODE><B>COPY-TREE</B></CODE> except,
instead of copying the whole tree structure, it copies only the cons
cells that make up the list structure, plus the cons cells directly
referenced from the <CODE><B>CAR</B></CODE>s of those cells. In other words, the
original alist and the copy will both contain the same objects as the
keys and values, even if those keys or values happen to be made up of
cons cells.</P><P>Finally, you can build an alist from two separate lists of keys and
values with the function <CODE><B>PAIRLIS</B></CODE>. The resulting alist may
contain the pairs either in the same order as the original lists or
in reverse order. For example, you may get this result:</P><PRE>CL-USER&gt; (pairlis '(a b c) '(1 2 3))
((C . 3) (B . 2) (A . 1))</PRE><P>Or you could just as well get this:</P><PRE>CL-USER&gt; (pairlis '(a b c) '(1 2 3))
((A . 1) (B . 2) (C . 3))</PRE><P>The other kind of lookup table is the property list, or plist, which
you used to represent the rows in the database in Chapter 3.
Structurally a plist is just a regular list with the keys and values
as alternating values. For instance, a plist mapping <CODE>A</CODE>,
<CODE>B</CODE>, and <CODE>C</CODE>, to 1, 2, and 3 is simply the list <CODE>(A 1
B 2 C 3)</CODE>. In boxes-and-arrows form, it looks like this: </P><P><IMG CLASS="figure" SRC="figures/plist-abc-123.png"/></P><P>However, plists are less flexible than alists. In fact, plists
support only one fundamental lookup operation, the function
<CODE><B>GETF</B></CODE>, which takes a plist and a key and returns the associated
value or <CODE><B>NIL</B></CODE> if the key isn't found. <CODE><B>GETF</B></CODE> also takes an
optional third argument, which will be returned in place of <CODE><B>NIL</B></CODE>
if the key isn't found.</P><P>Unlike <CODE><B>ASSOC</B></CODE>, which uses <CODE><B>EQL</B></CODE> as its default test and allows
a different test function to be supplied with a <CODE>:test</CODE>
argument, <CODE><B>GETF</B></CODE> always uses <CODE><B>EQ</B></CODE> to test whether the provided
key matches the keys in the plist. Consequently, you should never use
numbers or characters as keys in a plist; as you saw in Chapter 4,
the behavior of <CODE><B>EQ</B></CODE> for those types is essentially undefined.
Practically speaking, the keys in a plist are almost always symbols,
which makes sense since plists were first invented to implement
symbolic &quot;properties,&quot; arbitrary mappings between names and values.</P><P>You can use <CODE><B>SETF</B></CODE> with <CODE><B>GETF</B></CODE> to set the value associated with
a given key. <CODE><B>SETF</B></CODE> also treats <CODE><B>GETF</B></CODE> a bit specially in that
the first argument to <CODE><B>GETF</B></CODE> is treated as the place to modify.
Thus, you can use <CODE><B>SETF</B></CODE> of <CODE><B>GETF</B></CODE> to add a new key/value pair
to an existing plist. </P><PRE>CL-USER&gt; (defparameter *plist* ())

several properties from the same plist, Common Lisp provides a
function, <CODE><B>GET-PROPERTIES</B></CODE>, that makes it more efficient to extract
multiple values from a single plist. It takes a plist and a list of
keys to search for and returns, as multiple values, the first key
found, the corresponding value, and the head of the list starting with
the found key. This allows you to process a property list, extracting
the desired properties, without continually rescanning from the front
of the list. For instance, the following function efficiently
processes--using the hypothetical function
<CODE>process-property</CODE>--all the key/value pairs in a plist for a
given list of keys:</P><PRE>(defun process-properties (plist keys)

with symbols: every symbol object has an associated plist that can be
used to store information about the symbol. The plist can be obtained
via the function <CODE><B>SYMBOL-PLIST</B></CODE>. However, you rarely care about
the whole plist; more often you'll use the functions <CODE><B>GET</B></CODE>, which
takes a symbol and a key and is shorthand for a <CODE><B>GETF</B></CODE> of the same

replaced with a nested destructuring parameter list, which takes
apart the list that would otherwise have been bound to the replaced
parameter. The <I>list</I> form is evaluated once and should return a
list, which is then destructured and the appropriate values are bound
to the variables in the parameter list. Then the <I>body-forms</I> are
evaluated in order with those bindings in effect. Some simple

two chapters on the rather Lispy topic of cons cells, you can now

the result of <CODE><B>NSUBST</B></CODE> will be a different object than the
argument: <CODE>(nsubst 'x 'y 'y)  X</CODE>.</P><P><SUP>3</SUP><CODE><B>UNION</B></CODE> takes only one element from each
list, but if either list contains duplicate elements, the result may
also contain duplicates.</P><P><SUP>4</SUP>It's also possible to directly <CODE><B>SETF
SYMBOL-PLIST</B></CODE>. However, that's a bad idea, as different code may have
added different properties to the symbol's plist for different
reasons. If one piece of code clobbers the symbol's whole plist, it
may break other code that added its own properties to the plist.</P><P><SUP>5</SUP>Macro parameter lists do
support one parameter type, <CODE><B>&amp;environment</B></CODE> parameters, which
<CODE><B>DESTRUCTURING-BIND</B></CODE> doesn't. However, I didn't discuss that
parameter type in Chapter 8, and you don't need to worry about it now
either.</P><P><SUP>6</SUP>When a <CODE><B>&amp;whole</B></CODE> parameter is used in a macro parameter
list, the form it's bound to is the whole macro form, including the
name of the macro.</P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
