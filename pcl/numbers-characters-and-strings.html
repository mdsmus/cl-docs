Numbers, Characters, and Strings</H1><P>While functions, variables, macros, and 25 special operators provide
the basic building blocks of the language itself, the building blocks
of your programs will be the data structures you use. As Fred Brooks
observed in <I>The Mythical Man-Month</I>, &quot;Representation <I>is</I> the
essence of programming.&quot;<SUP>1</SUP></P><P>Common Lisp provides built-in support for most of the data types
typically found in modern languages: numbers (integer, floating
point, and complex), characters, strings, arrays (including
multidimensional arrays), lists, hash tables, input and output
streams, and an abstraction for portably representing filenames.
Functions are also a first-class data type in Lisp--they can be
stored in variables, passed as arguments, returned as return values,
and created at runtime.</P><P>And these built-in types are just the beginning. They're defined in
the language standard so programmers can count on them being
available and because they tend to be easier to implement efficiently
when tightly integrated with the rest of the implementation. But, as
you'll see in later chapters, Common Lisp also provides several ways
for you to define new data types, define operations on them, and
integrate them with the built-in data types.</P><P>For now, however, you can start with the built-in data types. Because
Lisp is a high-level language, the details of exactly how different
data types are implemented are largely hidden. From your point of
view as a user of the language, the built-in data types are defined
by the functions that operate on them. So to learn a data type, you
just have to learn about the functions you can use with it.
Additionally, most of the built-in data types have a special syntax
that the Lisp reader understands and that the Lisp printer uses.
That's why, for instance, you can write strings as <CODE>&quot;foo&quot;</CODE>;
numbers as <CODE>123</CODE>, <CODE>1/23</CODE>, and <CODE>1.23</CODE>; and lists as
<CODE>(a b c)</CODE>. I'll describe the syntax for different kinds of
objects when I describe the functions for manipulating them.</P><P>In this chapter, I'll cover the built-in &quot;scalar&quot; data types:
numbers, characters, and strings. Technically, strings aren't true
scalars--a string is a sequence of characters, and you can access
individual characters and manipulate strings with a function that
operates on sequences. But I'll discuss strings here because most of
the string-specific functions manipulate them as single values and
also because of the close relation between several of the string
functions and their character counterparts.</P><A NAME="numbers"><H2>Numbers</H2></A><P>Math, as Barbie says, is hard.<SUP>2</SUP> Common
Lisp can't make the math part any easier, but it does tend to get in
the way a lot less than other programming languages. That's not
surprising given its mathematical heritage. Lisp was originally
designed by a mathematician as a tool for studying mathematical
functions. And one of the main projects of the MAC project at MIT was
the Macsyma symbolic algebra system, written in Maclisp, one of
Common Lisp's immediate predecessors. Additionally, Lisp has been
used as a teaching language at places such as MIT where even the
computer science professors cringe at the thought of telling their
students that <I>10/4 = 2</I>, leading to Lisp's support for exact
ratios. And at various times Lisp has been called upon to compete
with FORTRAN in the high-performance numeric computing arena.</P><P>One of the reasons Lisp is a nice language for math is its numbers
behave more like true mathematical numbers than the approximations of
numbers that are easy to implement in finite computer hardware. For
instance, integers in Common Lisp can be almost arbitrarily large
rather than being limited by the size of a machine
word.<SUP>3</SUP> And dividing two integers results in an exact
ratio, not a truncated value. And since ratios are represented as
pairs of arbitrarily sized integers, ratios can represent arbitrarily
precise fractions.<SUP>4</SUP></P><P>On the other hand, for high-performance numeric programming, you may
be willing to trade the exactitude of rationals for the speed offered
by using the hardware's underlying floating-point operations. So,
Common Lisp also offers several types of floating-point numbers,
which are mapped by the implementation to the appropriate
hardware-supported floating-point representations.<SUP>5</SUP> Floats are also used
to represent the results of a computation whose true mathematical
value would be an irrational number.</P><P>Finally, Common Lisp supports complex numbers--the numbers that
result from doing things such as taking square roots and logarithms
of negative numbers. The Common Lisp standard even goes so far as to
specify the principal values and branch cuts for irrational and
transcendental functions on the complex domain. </P><A NAME="numeric-literals"><H2>Numeric Literals</H2></A><P>You can write numeric literals in a variety of ways; you saw a few
examples in Chapter 4. However, it's important to keep in mind the
division of labor between the Lisp reader and the Lisp evaluator--the
reader is responsible for translating text into Lisp objects, and the
Lisp evaluator then deals only with those objects. For a given number
of a given type, there can be many different textual representations,
all of which will be translated to the same object representation by
the Lisp reader. For instance, you can write the integer 10 as
<CODE>10</CODE>, <CODE>20/2</CODE>, <CODE>#xA</CODE>, or any of a number of other ways,
but the reader will translate all these to the same object. When
numbers are printed back out--say, at the REPL--they're printed in a
canonical textual syntax that may be different from the syntax used
to enter the number. For example:</P><PRE>CL-USER&gt; 10
10
CL-USER&gt; 20/2
10
CL-USER&gt; #xa
10</PRE><P>The syntax for integer values is an optional sign (<CODE>+</CODE> or
<CODE>-</CODE>) followed by one or more digits. Ratios are written as an
optional sign and a sequence of digits, representing the numerator, a
slash (<CODE>/</CODE>), and another sequence of digits representing the
denominator. All rational numbers are &quot;canonicalized&quot; as they're
read--that's why <CODE>10</CODE> and <CODE>20/2</CODE> are both read as the same
number, as are <CODE>3/4</CODE> and <CODE>6/8</CODE>. Rationals are printed in
&quot;reduced&quot; form--integer values are printed in integer syntax and
ratios with the numerator and denominator reduced to lowest terms. </P><P>It's also possible to write rationals in bases other than 10. If
preceded by <CODE>#B</CODE> or <CODE>#b</CODE>, a rational literal is read as a
binary number with <CODE>0</CODE> and <CODE>1</CODE> as the only legal digits. An
<CODE>#O</CODE> or <CODE>#o</CODE> indicates an octal number (legal digits
<CODE>0</CODE>-<CODE>7</CODE>), and <CODE>#X</CODE> or <CODE>#x</CODE> indicates hexadecimal
(legal digits <CODE>0</CODE>-<CODE>F</CODE> or <CODE>0</CODE>-<CODE>f</CODE>). You can write
rationals in other bases from 2 to 36 with <CODE>#nR</CODE> where <I>n</I> is
the base (always written in decimal). Additional &quot;digits&quot; beyond 9
are taken from the letters <CODE>A</CODE>-<CODE>Z</CODE> or <CODE>a</CODE>-<CODE>z</CODE>.
Note that these radix indicators apply to the whole rational--it's
not possible to write a ratio with the numerator in one base and
denominator in another. Also, you can write integer values, but not
ratios, as decimal digits terminated with a decimal point.<SUP>6</SUP> Some examples of rationals,
with their canonical, decimal representation are as follows: </P><PRE>123                            ==&gt; 123

Unlike rational numbers, the syntax used to notate a floating-point
number can affect the actual type of number read. Common Lisp defines
four subtypes of floating-point number: short, single, double, and
long. Each subtype can use a different number of bits in its
representation, which means each subtype can represent values
spanning a different range and with different precision. More bits
gives a wider range and more precision.<SUP>7</SUP> </P><P>The basic format for floating-point numbers is an optional sign
followed by a nonempty sequence of decimal digits possibly with an
embedded decimal point. This sequence can be followed by an exponent
marker for &quot;computerized scientific notation.&quot;<SUP>8</SUP> The exponent marker consists of a single
letter followed by an optional sign and a sequence of digits, which
are interpreted as the power of ten by which the number before the
exponent marker should be multiplied. The letter does double duty: it
marks the beginning of the exponent and indicates what floating-
point representation should be used for the number. The exponent
markers <I>s</I>, <I>f</I>, <I>d</I>, <I>l</I> (and their uppercase equivalents)
indicate short, single, double, and long floats, respectively. The
letter <I>e</I> indicates that the default representation (initially
single-float) should be used.</P><P>Numbers with no exponent marker are read in the default
representation and must contain a decimal point followed by at least
one digit to distinguish them from integers. The digits in a
floating-point number are always treated as base 10 digits--the
<CODE>#B</CODE>, <CODE>#X</CODE>, <CODE>#O</CODE>, and <CODE>#R</CODE> syntaxes work only
with rationals. The following are some example floating-point numbers
along with their canonical representation:</P><PRE>1.0      ==&gt; 1.0
1e0      ==&gt; 1.0
1d0      ==&gt; 1.0d0

0.123    ==&gt; 0.123

0.123e20 ==&gt; 1.23e+19
123d23   ==&gt; 1.23d+25</PRE><P>Finally, complex numbers are written in their own syntax, namely,
<CODE>#C</CODE> or <CODE>#c</CODE> followed by a list of two real numbers
representing the real and imaginary part of the complex number. There
are actually five kinds of complex numbers because the real and
imaginary parts must either both be rational or both be the same kind
of floating-point number. </P><P>But you can write them however you want--if a complex is written with
one rational and one floating-point part, the rational is converted
to a float of the appropriate representation. Similarly, if the real
and imaginary parts are both floats of different representations, the
one in the smaller representation will be <I>upgraded</I>.</P><P>However, no complex numbers have a rational real component and a zero
imaginary part--since such values are, mathematically speaking,
rational, they're represented by the appropriate rational value. The
same mathematical argument could be made for complex numbers with
floating-point components, but for those complex types a number with
a zero imaginary part is always a different object than the
floating-point number representing the real component. Here are some
examples of numbers written the complex number syntax: </P><PRE>#c(2      1)    ==&gt; #c(2 1)

multiplication, and division--are supported for all the different
kinds of Lisp numbers with the functions <CODE><B>+</B></CODE>, <CODE><B>-</B></CODE>, <CODE><B>*</B></CODE>, and
<CODE><B>/</B></CODE>. Calling any of these functions with more than two arguments is
equivalent to calling the same function on the first two arguments and
then calling it again on the resulting value and the rest of the
arguments. For example, <CODE>(+ 1 2 3)</CODE> is equivalent to <CODE>(+ (+
1 2) 3)</CODE>. With only one argument, <CODE><B>+</B></CODE> and <CODE><B>*</B></CODE> return the value;

but one or more are floating-point numbers, the other arguments are
converted to the nearest floating-point value in a &quot;largest&quot;
floating-point representation of the actual floating-point arguments.

truncating and rounding for converting a real number (rational or

argument. <CODE><B>CEILING</B></CODE> truncates toward positive infinity, returning
the smallest integer greater than or equal to the argument.
<CODE><B>TRUNCATE</B></CODE> truncates toward zero, making it equivalent to
<CODE><B>FLOOR</B></CODE> for positive arguments and to <CODE><B>CEILING</B></CODE> for negative

That's as it should be--characters are <I>not</I> numbers, and
languages that treat them as if they are tend to run into problems
when character encodings change, say, from 8-bit ASCII to 21-bit
Unicode.<SUP>11</SUP> Because the Common Lisp
standard didn't mandate a particular representation for characters,
today several Lisp implementations use Unicode as their &quot;native&quot;
character encoding despite Unicode being only a gleam in a standards
body's eye at the time Common Lisp's own standardization was being
wrapped up.</P><P>The read syntax for characters objects is simple: <CODE>#\</CODE> followed
by the desired character. Thus, <CODE>#\x</CODE> is the character <CODE>x</CODE>.
Any character can be used after the <CODE>#\</CODE>, including otherwise
special characters such as <CODE>&quot;</CODE>, <CODE>(</CODE>, and whitespace.
However, writing whitespace characters this way isn't very (human)
readable; an alternative syntax for certain characters is <CODE>#\</CODE>
followed by the character's name. Exactly what names are supported
depends on the character set and on the Lisp implementation, but all
implementations support the names <I>Space</I> and <I>Newline</I>. Thus,
you should write <CODE>#\Space</CODE> instead of <CODE>#\ </CODE>, though the
latter is technically legal. Other semistandard names (that
implementations must use if the character set has the appropriate
characters) are <I>Tab</I>, <I>Page</I>, <I>Rubout</I>, <I>Linefeed</I>,
<I>Return</I>, and <I>Backspace</I>. </P><A NAME="character-comparisons"><H2>Character Comparisons</H2></A><P>The main thing you can do with characters, other than putting them

them with other characters. Since characters aren't numbers, you
can't use the numeric comparison functions, such as <CODE><B>&lt;</B></CODE> and
<CODE><B>&gt;</B></CODE>. Instead, two sets of functions provide character-specific
analogs to the numeric comparators; one set is case-sensitive and
the other case-insensitive.</P><P>The case-sensitive analog to the numeric <CODE><B>=</B></CODE> is the function
<CODE><B>CHAR=</B></CODE>. Like <CODE><B>=</B></CODE>, <CODE><B>CHAR=</B></CODE> can take any number of arguments

insensitive version is <CODE><B>CHAR-EQUAL</B></CODE>.</P><P>The rest of the character comparators follow this same naming scheme:
the case-sensitive comparators are named by prepending the analogous
numeric comparator with <CODE>CHAR</CODE>; the case-insensitive versions
spell out the comparator name, separated from the <CODE>CHAR</CODE> with a
hyphen. Note, however, that <CODE>&lt;=</CODE> and <CODE>&gt;=</CODE> are &quot;spelled out&quot;

data type, namely, a one-dimensional array of characters.
Consequently, I'll cover many of the things you can do with strings in
the next chapter when I discuss the many functions for manipulating
sequences, of which strings are just one type. But strings also have
their own literal syntax and a library of functions for performing
string-specific operations. I'll discuss these aspects of strings in
this chapter and leave the others for Chapter 11.</P><P>As you've seen, literal strings are written enclosed in double
quotes. You can include any character supported by the character set
in a literal string except double quote (<CODE>&quot;</CODE>) and backslash ().
And you can include these two as well if you escape them with a
backslash. In fact, backslash always escapes the next character,
whatever it is, though this isn't necessary for any character except
for <CODE>&quot;</CODE> and  itself. Table 10-2 shows how various literal
strings will be read by the Lisp reader.</P><P><DIV CLASS="table-caption">Table 10-2.

adding the enclosing quotation marks and any necessary escaping

you need to use function such as <CODE><B>FORMAT</B></CODE> designed to print
human-readable output. For example, here's what you see if you type a
string containing an embedded quotation mark at the REPL: </P><PRE>CL-USER&gt; &quot;foo\&quot;bar&quot;
&quot;foo\&quot;bar&quot;</PRE><P><CODE><B>FORMAT</B></CODE>, on the other hand, will show you the actual string

comparators can compare only two strings. That's because they also
take keyword arguments that allow you to restrict the comparison to a
substring of either or both strings. The arguments--<CODE>:start1</CODE>,
<CODE>:end1</CODE>, <CODE>:start2</CODE>, and <CODE>:end2</CODE>--specify the starting
(inclusive) and ending (exclusive) indices of substrings in the first
and second string arguments. Thus, the following: </P><PRE>(string= &quot;foobarbaz&quot; &quot;quuxbarfoo&quot; :start1 3 :end1 6 :start2 4 :end2 7)</PRE><P>compares the substring &quot;bar&quot; in the two arguments and returns true.
The <CODE>:end1</CODE> and <CODE>:end2</CODE> arguments can be <CODE><B>NIL</B></CODE> (or the
keyword argument omitted altogether) to indicate that the
corresponding substring extends to the end of the string.</P><P>The comparators that return true when their arguments differ--that
is, all of them except <CODE><B>STRING=</B></CODE> and <CODE><B>STRING-EQUAL</B></CODE>--return the
index in the first string where the mismatch was detected.</P><PRE>(string/= &quot;lisp&quot; &quot;lissome&quot;) ==&gt; 3</PRE><P>If the first string is a prefix of the second, the return value will
be the length of the first string, that is, one greater than the
largest valid index into the string.</P><PRE>(string&lt; &quot;lisp&quot; &quot;lisper&quot;) ==&gt; 4</PRE><P>When comparing substrings, the resulting value is still an index into
the string as a whole. For instance, the following compares the
substrings &quot;bar&quot; and &quot;baz&quot; but returns 5 because that's the index of
the <I>r</I> in the first string: </P><PRE>(string&lt; &quot;foobar&quot; &quot;abaz&quot; :start1 3 :start2 1) ==&gt; 5   ; N.B. not 2</PRE><P>Other string functions allow you to convert the case of strings and
trim characters from one or both ends of a string. And, as I
mentioned previously, since strings are really a kind of sequence,
all the sequence functions I'll discuss in the next chapter can be
used with strings. For instance, you can discover the length of a
string with the <CODE><B>LENGTH</B></CODE> function and can get and set individual
characters of a string with the generic sequence element accessor
function, <CODE><B>ELT</B></CODE>, or the generic array element accessor function,
<CODE><B>AREF</B></CODE>. Or you can use the string-specific accessor, <CODE><B>CHAR</B></CODE>.
But those functions, and others, are the topic of the next chapter,
so let's move on.

Emphasis in original.</P><P><SUP>2</SUP>Mattel's Teen Talk Barbie</P><P><SUP>3</SUP>Obviously, the size of a number that can be represented on
a computer with finite memory is still limited in practice;
furthermore, the actual representation of <I>bignums</I> used in a
particular Common Lisp implementation may place other limits on the
size of number that can be represented. But these limits are going to
be well beyond &quot;astronomically&quot; large numbers. For instance, the
number of atoms in the universe is estimated to be less than 2^269;
current Common Lisp implementations can easily handle numbers up to
and beyond 2^262144.</P><P><SUP>4</SUP>Folks interested in using Common Lisp for
intensive numeric computation should note that a naive comparison of
the performance of numeric code in Common Lisp and languages such as
C or FORTRAN will probably show Common Lisp to be much slower. This
is because something as simple as <CODE>(+ a b)</CODE> in Common Lisp is
doing a lot more than the seemingly equivalent <CODE>a + b</CODE> in one of
those languages. Because of Lisp's dynamic typing and support for
things such as arbitrary precision rationals and complex numbers, a
seemingly simple addition is doing a lot more than an addition of two
numbers that are known to be represented by machine words. However,
you can use declarations to give Common Lisp information about the
types of numbers you're using that will enable it to generate code
that does only as much work as the code that would be generated by a
C or FORTRAN compiler. Tuning numeric code for this kind of
performance is beyond the scope of this book, but it's certainly
possible.</P><P><SUP>5</SUP>While the
standard doesn't require it, many Common Lisp implementations support
the IEEE standard for floating-point arithmetic, <I>IEEE Standard for
Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic, ANSI/ IEEE Std 754-1985</I> (Institute
of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, 1985).</P><P><SUP>6</SUP>It's
also possible to change the default base the reader uses for numbers
without a specific radix marker by changing the value of the global
variable <CODE><B>*READ-BASE*</B></CODE>. However, it's not clear that's the path to
anything other than complete insanity.</P><P><SUP>7</SUP>Since the purpose of
floating-point numbers is to make efficient use of floating-point
hardware, each Lisp implementation is allowed to map these four
subtypes onto the native floating-point types as appropriate. If the
hardware supports fewer than four distinct representations, one or
more of the types may be equivalent.</P><P><SUP>8</SUP>&quot;Computerized
scientific notation&quot; is in scare quotes because, while commonly used
in computer languages since the days of FORTRAN, it's actually quite
different from real scientific notation. In particular, something
like <CODE>1.0e4</CODE> means <CODE>10000.0</CODE>, but in true scientific
notation that would be written as 1.0 x 10^4. And to further confuse
matters, in true scientific notation the letter <I>e</I> stands for the
base of the natural logarithm, so something like 1.0 x <I>e</I>^4, while
superficially similar to <CODE>1.0e4</CODE>, is a completely different
value, approximately 54.6.</P><P><SUP>9</SUP>For
mathematical consistency, <CODE><B>+</B></CODE> and <CODE><B>*</B></CODE> can also be called with no
arguments, in which case they return the appropriate identity: 0 for
<CODE><B>+</B></CODE> and 1 for <CODE><B>*</B></CODE>.</P><P><SUP>10</SUP>Roughly speaking,
<CODE><B>MOD</B></CODE> is equivalent to the <CODE>%</CODE> operator in Perl and Python,
and <CODE><B>REM</B></CODE> is equivalent to the % in C and Java. (Technically, the
exact behavior of % in C wasn't specified until the C99 standard.)</P><P><SUP>11</SUP>Even Java, which was designed from the beginning to use
Unicode characters on the theory that Unicode was the going to be
<I>the</I> character encoding of the future, has run into trouble since
Java characters are defined to be a 16-bit quantity and the Unicode
3.1 standard extended the range of the Unicode character set to
require a 21-bit representation. Ooops.</P><P><SUP>12</SUP>Note, however, that not all literal strings can be
printed by passing them as the second argument to <CODE><B>FORMAT</B></CODE> since
certain sequences of characters have a special meaning to
<CODE><B>FORMAT</B></CODE>. To safely print an arbitrary string--say, the value of a
variable s--with <CODE><B>FORMAT</B></CODE> you should write (format t &quot;~a&quot; s).</P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
