Practical: Building a Unit Test Framework</H1><P>In this chapter you'll return to cutting code and develop a simple
unit testing framework for Lisp. This will give you a chance to use
some of the features you've learned about since Chapter 3, including
macros and dynamic variables, in real code.</P><P>The main design goal of the test framework will be to make it as easy
as possible to add new tests, to run various suites of tests, and to
track down test failures. For now you'll focus on designing a
framework you can use during interactive development.</P><P>The key feature of an automated testing framework is that the
framework is responsible for telling you whether all the tests
passed. You don't want to spend your time slogging through test
output checking answers when the computer can do it much more quickly
and accurately. Consequently, each test case must be an expression
that yields a boolean value--true or false, pass or fail. For
instance, if you were writing tests for the built-in <CODE><B>+</B></CODE> function,
these might be reasonable test cases:<SUP>1</SUP></P><PRE>(= (+ 1 2) 3)
(= (+ 1 2 3) 6)
(= (+ -1 -3) -4)</PRE><P>Functions that have side effects will be tested slightly
differently--you'll have to call the function and then check for
evidence of the expected side effects.<SUP>2</SUP> But in the end, every test case has to boil down to a
boolean expression, thumbs up or thumbs down. </P><A NAME="two-first-tries"><H2>Two First Tries</H2></A><P>If you were doing ad hoc testing, you could enter these expressions
at the REPL and check that they return <CODE><B>T</B></CODE>. But you want a
framework that makes it easy to organize and run these test cases
whenever you want. If you want to start with the simplest thing that
could possibly work, you can just write a function that evaluates the
test cases and <CODE><B>AND</B></CODE>s the results together.</P><PRE>(defun test-+ ()
  (and
    (= (+ 1 2) 3)
    (= (+ 1 2 3) 6)
    (= (+ -1 -3) -4)))</PRE><P>Whenever you want to run this set of test cases, you can call
<CODE>test-+</CODE>.</P><PRE>CL-USER&gt; (test-+)
T</PRE><P>As long as it returns <CODE><B>T</B></CODE>, you know the test cases are passing.
This way of organizing tests is also pleasantly concise--you don't
have to write a bunch of test bookkeeping code. However, as you'll
discover the first time a test case fails, the result reporting
leaves something to be desired. When <CODE>test-+</CODE> returns <CODE><B>NIL</B></CODE>,
you'll know something failed, but you'll have no idea which test case
it was.</P><P>So let's try another simple--even simpleminded--approach. To find out
what happens to each test case, you could write something like this:</P><PRE>(defun test-+ ()
  (format t &quot;~:[FAIL~;pass~] ... ~a~%&quot; (= (+ 1 2) 3) '(= (+ 1 2) 3))
  (format t &quot;~:[FAIL~;pass~] ... ~a~%&quot; (= (+ 1 2 3) 6) '(= (+ 1 2 3) 6))
  (format t &quot;~:[FAIL~;pass~] ... ~a~%&quot; (= (+ -1 -3) -4) '(= (+ -1 -3) -4)))</PRE><P>Now each test case will be reported individually. The
<CODE>~:[FAIL~;pass~]</CODE> part of the <CODE><B>FORMAT</B></CODE> directive causes
<CODE><B>FORMAT</B></CODE> to print &quot;FAIL&quot; if the first format argument is false and
&quot;pass&quot; otherwise.<SUP>3</SUP> Then you label the result
with the test expression itself. Now running <CODE>test-+</CODE> shows you
exactly what's going on.</P><PRE>CL-USER&gt; (test-+)
pass ... (= (+ 1 2) 3)
pass ... (= (+ 1 2 3) 6)
pass ... (= (+ -1 -3) -4)
NIL</PRE><P>This time the result reporting is more like what you want, but the
code itself is pretty gross. The repeated calls to <CODE><B>FORMAT</B></CODE> as
well as the tedious duplication of the test expression cry out to be
refactored. The duplication of the test expression is particularly
grating because if you mistype it, the test results will be
mislabeled.</P><P>Another problem is that you don't get a single indicator whether all
the test cases passed. It's easy enough, with only three test cases,
to scan the output looking for &quot;FAIL&quot;; however, when you have
hundreds of test cases, it'll be more of a hassle.</P><A NAME="refactoring"><H2>Refactoring</H2></A><P>What you'd really like is a way to write test functions as
streamlined as the first <CODE>test-+</CODE> that return a single <CODE><B>T</B></CODE> or
<CODE><B>NIL</B></CODE> value but that also report on the results of individual test
cases like the second version. Since the second version is close to
what you want in terms of functionality, your best bet is to see if
you can factor out some of the annoying duplication.</P><P>The simplest way to get rid of the repeated similar calls to
<CODE><B>FORMAT</B></CODE> is to create a new function.</P><PRE>(defun report-result (result form)
  (format t &quot;~:[FAIL~;pass~] ... ~a~%&quot; result form))</PRE><P>Now you can write <CODE>test-+</CODE> with calls to <CODE>report-result</CODE>
instead of <CODE><B>FORMAT</B></CODE>. It's not a huge improvement, but at least now
if you decide to change the way you report results, there's only one
place you have to change.</P><PRE>(defun test-+ ()
  (report-result (= (+ 1 2) 3) '(= (+ 1 2) 3))
  (report-result (= (+ 1 2 3) 6) '(= (+ 1 2 3) 6))
  (report-result (= (+ -1 -3) -4) '(= (+ -1 -3) -4)))</PRE><P>Next you need to get rid of the duplication of the test case
expression, with its attendant risk of mislabeling of results. What
you'd really like is to be able to treat the expression as both code
(to get the result) and data (to use as the label). Whenever you want
to treat code as data, that's a sure sign you need a macro. Or, to
look at it another way, what you need is a way to automate writing
the error-prone <CODE>report-result</CODE> calls. You'd like to be able to
say something like this: </P><PRE>(check (= (+ 1 2) 3))</PRE><P>and have it mean the following:</P><PRE>(report-result (= (+ 1 2) 3) '(= (+ 1 2) 3))</PRE><P>Writing a macro to do this translation is trivial.</P><PRE>(defmacro check (form)
  `(report-result ,form ',form))</PRE><P>Now you can change <CODE>test-+</CODE> to use <CODE>check</CODE>.</P><PRE>(defun test-+ ()
  (check (= (+ 1 2) 3))
  (check (= (+ 1 2 3) 6))
  (check (= (+ -1 -3) -4)))</PRE><P>Since you're on the hunt for duplication, why not get rid of those
repeated calls to <CODE>check</CODE>? You can define <CODE>check</CODE> to take
an arbitrary number of forms and wrap them each in a call to
<CODE>report-result</CODE>. </P><PRE>(defmacro check (&amp;body forms)
  `(progn
     ,@(loop for f in forms collect `(report-result ,f ',f))))</PRE><P>This definition uses a common macro idiom of wrapping a <CODE><B>PROGN</B></CODE>
around a series of forms in order to turn them into a single form.
Notice also how you can use <CODE>,@</CODE> to splice in the result of an
expression that returns a list of expressions that are themselves
generated with a backquote template.</P><P>With the new version of <CODE>check</CODE> you can write a new version of
<CODE>test-+</CODE> like this:</P><PRE>(defun test-+ ()
  (check
    (= (+ 1 2) 3)
    (= (+ 1 2 3) 6)
    (= (+ -1 -3) -4)))</PRE><P>that is equivalent to the following code:</P><PRE>(defun test-+ ()
  (progn
    (report-result (= (+ 1 2) 3) '(= (+ 1 2) 3))
    (report-result (= (+ 1 2 3) 6) '(= (+ 1 2 3) 6))
    (report-result (= (+ -1 -3) -4) '(= (+ -1 -3) -4))))</PRE><P>Thanks to <CODE>check</CODE>, this version is as concise as the first
version of <CODE>test-+</CODE> but expands into code that does the same
thing as the second version. And now any changes you want to make to
how <CODE>test-+</CODE> behaves, you can make by changing <CODE>check</CODE>. </P><A NAME="fixing-the-return-value"><H2>Fixing the Return Value</H2></A><P>You can start with fixing <CODE>test-+</CODE> so its return value indicates
whether all the test cases passed. Since <CODE>check</CODE> is responsible
for generating the code that ultimately runs the test cases, you just
need to change it to generate code that also keeps track of the
results.</P><P>As a first step, you can make a small change to <CODE>report-result</CODE>
so it returns the result of the test case it's reporting.</P><PRE>(defun report-result (result form)
  (format t &quot;~:[FAIL~;pass~] ... ~a~%&quot; result form)
  result)</PRE><P>Now that <CODE>report-result</CODE> returns the result of its test case, it
might seem you could just change the <CODE><B>PROGN</B></CODE> to an <CODE><B>AND</B></CODE> to
combine the results. Unfortunately, <CODE><B>AND</B></CODE> doesn't do quite what
you want in this case because of its short-circuiting behavior: as
soon as one test case fails, <CODE><B>AND</B></CODE> will skip the rest. On the
other hand, if you had a construct that worked like <CODE><B>AND</B></CODE> without
the short-circuiting, you could use it in the place of <CODE><B>PROGN</B></CODE>,
and you'd be done. Common Lisp doesn't provide such a construct, but
that's no reason you can't use it: it's a trivial matter to write a
macro to provide it yourself. </P><P>Leaving test cases aside for a moment, what you want is a
macro--let's call it <CODE>combine-results</CODE>--that will let you say
this:</P><PRE>(combine-results
  (foo)
  (bar)
  (baz))</PRE><P>and have it mean something like this:</P><PRE>(let ((result t))
  (unless (foo) (setf result nil))
  (unless (bar) (setf result nil))
  (unless (baz) (setf result nil))
  result)</PRE><P>The only tricky bit to writing this macro is that you need to
introduce a variable--<CODE>result</CODE> in the previous code--in the
expansion. As you saw in the previous chapter, using a literal name
for variables in macro expansions can introduce a leak in your macro
abstraction, so you'll need to create a unique name. This is a job
for <CODE>with-gensyms</CODE>. You can define <CODE>combine-results</CODE> like
this: </P><PRE>(defmacro combine-results (&amp;body forms)
  (with-gensyms (result)
    `(let ((,result t))
      ,@(loop for f in forms collect `(unless ,f (setf ,result nil)))
      ,result)))</PRE><P>Now you can fix <CODE>check</CODE> by simply changing the expansion to use
<CODE>combine-results</CODE> instead of <CODE><B>PROGN</B></CODE>.</P><PRE>(defmacro check (&amp;body forms)
  `(combine-results
    ,@(loop for f in forms collect `(report-result ,f ',f))))</PRE><P>With that version of <CODE>check</CODE>, <CODE>test-+</CODE> should emit the
results of its three test expressions and then return <CODE><B>T</B></CODE> to
indicate that everything passed.<SUP>4</SUP></P><PRE>CL-USER&gt; (test-+)
pass ... (= (+ 1 2) 3)
pass ... (= (+ 1 2 3) 6)
pass ... (= (+ -1 -3) -4)

NIL</PRE><A NAME="better-result-reporting"><H2>Better Result Reporting</H2></A><P>As long as you have only one test function, the current result
reporting is pretty clear. If a particular test case fails, all you
have to do is find the test case in the <CODE>check</CODE> form and figure
out why it's failing. But if you write a lot of tests, you'll
probably want to organize them somehow, rather than shoving them all
into one function. For instance, suppose you wanted to add some test
cases for the <CODE>*</CODE> function. You might write a new test function.</P><PRE>(defun test-* ()
  (check
    (= (* 2 2) 4)
    (= (* 3 5) 15)))</PRE><P>Now that you have two test functions, you'll probably want another
function that runs all the tests. That's easy enough.</P><PRE>(defun test-arithmetic ()
  (combine-results
   (test-+)
   (test-*)))</PRE><P>In this function you use <CODE>combine-results</CODE> instead of
<CODE>check</CODE> since both <CODE>test-+</CODE> and <CODE>test-*</CODE> will take
care of reporting their own results. When you run
<CODE>test-arithmetic</CODE>, you'll get the following results: </P><PRE>CL-USER&gt; (test-arithmetic)

pass ... (= (+ 1 2 3) 6)
pass ... (= (+ -1 -3) -4)
pass ... (= (* 2 2) 4)
pass ... (= (* 3 5) 15)
T</PRE><P>Now imagine that one of the test cases failed and you need to track
down the problem. With only five test cases and two test functions,
it won't be too hard to find the code of the failing test case. But
suppose you had 500 test cases spread across 20 functions. It might
be nice if the results told you what function each test case came
from.</P><P>Since the code that prints the results is centralized in
<CODE>report-result</CODE>, you need a way to pass information about what
test function you're in to <CODE>report-result</CODE>. You could add a
parameter to <CODE>report-result</CODE> to pass this information, but
<CODE>check</CODE>, which generates the calls to <CODE>report-result</CODE>,
doesn't know what function it's being called from, which means you'd
also have to change the way you call <CODE>check</CODE>, passing it an
argument that it simply passes onto <CODE>report-result</CODE>. </P><P>This is exactly the kind of problem dynamic variables were designed
to solve. If you create a dynamic variable that each test function
binds to the name of the function before calling <CODE>check</CODE>, then
<CODE>report-result</CODE> can use it without <CODE>check</CODE> having to know
anything about it.</P><P>Step one is to declare the variable at the top level.</P><PRE>(defvar *test-name* nil)</PRE><P>Now you need to make another tiny change to <CODE>report-result</CODE> to
include <CODE>*test-name*</CODE> in the <CODE><B>FORMAT</B></CODE> output.</P><PRE>(format t &quot;~:[FAIL~;pass~] ... ~a: ~a~%&quot; result *test-name* form)</PRE><P>With those changes, the test functions will still work but will
produce the following output because <CODE>*test-name*</CODE> is never
rebound: </P><PRE>CL-USER&gt; (test-arithmetic)

T</PRE><A NAME="an-abstraction-emerges"><H2>An Abstraction Emerges</H2></A><P>In fixing the test functions, you've introduced several new bits of
duplication. Not only does each function have to include the name of
the function twice--once as the name in the <CODE><B>DEFUN</B></CODE> and once in
the binding of <CODE>*test-name*</CODE>--but the same three-line code
pattern is duplicated between the two functions. You could remove the
duplication simply on the grounds that duplication is bad. But if you
look more closely at the root cause of the duplication, you can learn
an important lesson about how to use macros.</P><P>The reason both these functions start the same way is because they're
both test functions. The duplication arises because, at the moment,
<I>test function</I> is only half an abstraction. The abstraction exists
in your mind, but in the code there's no way to express &quot;this is a
test function&quot; other than to write code that follows a particular
pattern.</P><P>Unfortunately, partial abstractions are a crummy tool for building
software. Because a half abstraction is expressed in code by a
manifestation of the pattern, you're guaranteed to have massive code
duplication with all the normal bad consequences that implies for
maintainability. More subtly, because the abstraction exists only in
the minds of programmers, there's no mechanism to make sure different
programmers (or even the same programmer working at different times)
actually understand the abstraction the same way. To make a complete
abstraction, you need a way to express &quot;this is a test function&quot; and
have all the code required by the pattern be generated for you. In
other words, you need a macro.</P><P>Because the pattern you're trying to capture is a <CODE><B>DEFUN</B></CODE> plus
some boilerplate code, you need to write a macro that will expand
into a <CODE><B>DEFUN</B></CODE>. You'll then use this macro, instead of a plain
<CODE><B>DEFUN</B></CODE> to define test functions, so it makes sense to call it
<CODE>deftest</CODE>.</P><PRE>(defmacro deftest (name parameters &amp;body body)
  `(defun ,name ,parameters
    (let ((*test-name* ',name))

    (= (+ -1 -3) -4)))</PRE><A NAME="a-hierarchy-of-tests"><H2>A Hierarchy of Tests</H2></A><P>Now that you've established test functions as first-class citizens,
the question might arise, should <CODE>test-arithmetic</CODE> be a test
function? As things stand, it doesn't really matter--if you did
define it with <CODE>deftest</CODE>, its binding of <CODE>*test-name*</CODE>
would be shadowed by the bindings in <CODE>test-+</CODE> and <CODE>test-*</CODE>
before any results are reported.</P><P>But now imagine you've got thousands of test cases to organize. The
first level of organization is provided by test functions such as
<CODE>test-+</CODE> and <CODE>test-*</CODE> that directly call <CODE>check</CODE>. But
with thousands of test cases, you'll likely need other levels of
organization. Functions such as <CODE>test-arithmetic</CODE> can group
related test functions into test suites. Now suppose some low-level
test functions are called from multiple test suites. It's not unheard
of for a test case to pass in one context but fail in another. If
that happens, you'll probably want to know more than just what
low-level test function contains the test case.</P><P>If you define the test suite functions such as <CODE>test-arithmetic</CODE>
with <CODE>deftest</CODE> and make a small change to the <CODE>*test-name*</CODE>
bookkeeping, you can have results reported with a &quot;fully qualified&quot;
path to the test case, something like this: </P><PRE>pass ... (TEST-ARITHMETIC TEST-+): (= (+ 1 2) 3)</PRE><P>Because you've already abstracted the process of defining a test
function, you can change the bookkeeping details without modifying
the code of the test functions.<SUP>6</SUP> To make <CODE>*test-name*</CODE> hold a list of test
function names instead of just the name of the most recently entered
test function, you just need to change this binding form:</P><PRE>(let ((*test-name* ',name))</PRE><P>to the following:</P><PRE>(let ((*test-name* (append *test-name* (list ',name))))</PRE><P>Since <CODE><B>APPEND</B></CODE> returns a new list made up of the elements of its

tacked onto the end.<SUP>7</SUP> When
each test function returns, the old value of <CODE>*test-name*</CODE> will

But as a framework for writing tests with a minimum of busywork and
easily running them from the REPL, this is a reasonable start. Here's
the complete code, all 26 lines of it:</P><PRE>(defvar *test-name* nil)

(defmacro deftest (name parameters &amp;body body)

  result)</PRE><P>It's worth reviewing how you got here because it's illustrative of
how programming in Lisp often goes.</P><P>You started by defining a simple version of your problem--how to
evaluate a bunch of boolean expressions and find out if they all
returned true. Just <CODE><B>AND</B></CODE>ing them together worked and was
syntactically clean but revealed the need for better result
reporting. So you wrote some really simpleminded code, chock-full of
duplication and error-prone idioms that reported the results the way
you wanted.</P><P>The next step was to see if you could refactor the second version
into something as clean as the former. You started with a standard
refactoring technique of extracting some code into a function,
<CODE>report-result</CODE>. Unfortunately, you could see that using
<CODE>report-result</CODE> was going to be tedious and error-prone since
you had to pass the test expression twice, once for the value and
once as quoted data. So you wrote the <CODE>check</CODE> macro to automate
the details of calling <CODE>report-result</CODE> correctly.</P><P>While writing <CODE>check</CODE>, you realized as long as you were
generating code, you could make a single call to <CODE>check</CODE> to
generate multiple calls to <CODE>report-result</CODE>, getting you back to
a version of <CODE>test-+</CODE> about as concise as the original <CODE><B>AND</B></CODE>
version.</P><P>At that point you had the <CODE>check</CODE> API nailed down, which allowed
you to start mucking with how it worked on the inside. The next task
was to fix <CODE>check</CODE> so the code it generated would return a
boolean indicating whether all the test cases had passed. Rather than
immediately hacking away at <CODE>check</CODE>, you paused to indulge in a
little language design by fantasy. What if--you fantasized--there was
already a non-short-circuiting <CODE><B>AND</B></CODE> construct. Then fixing
<CODE>check</CODE> would be trivial. Returning from fantasyland you
realized there was no such construct but that you could write one in
a few lines. After writing <CODE>combine-results</CODE>, the fix to
<CODE>check</CODE> was indeed trivial.</P><P>At that point all that was left was to make a few more improvements
to the way you reported test results. Once you started making changes
to the test functions, you realized those functions represented a
special category of function that deserved its own abstraction. So
you wrote <CODE>deftest</CODE> to abstract the pattern of code that turns a
regular function into a test function.</P><P>With <CODE>deftest</CODE> providing an abstraction barrier between the test
definitions and the underlying machinery, you were able to enhance
the result reporting without touching the test functions.</P><P>Now, with the basics of functions, variables, and macros mastered,
and a little practical experience using them, you're ready to start
exploring Common Lisp's rich standard library of functions and data
types.
</P><HR/><DIV CLASS="notes"><P><SUP>1</SUP>This is for illustrative
purposes only--obviously, writing test cases for built-in functions
such as <CODE><B>+</B></CODE> is a bit silly, since if such basic things aren't
working, the chances the tests will be running the way you expect is
pretty slim. On the other hand, most Common Lisps are implemented
largely in Common Lisp, so it's not crazy to imagine writing test
suites in Common Lisp to test the standard library functions.</P><P><SUP>2</SUP>Side effects can include
such things as signaling errors; I'll discuss Common Lisp's error
handling system in Chapter 19. You may, after reading that chapter,
want to think about how to incorporate tests that check whether a

situations.</P><P><SUP>3</SUP>I'll discuss this and other <CODE><B>FORMAT</B></CODE>
directives in more detail in Chapter 18.</P><P><SUP>4</SUP>If <CODE>test-+</CODE> has been
compiled--which may happen implicitly in certain Lisp
implementations--you may need to reevaluate the definition of
<CODE>test-+</CODE> to get the changed definition of <CODE>check</CODE> to affect
the behavior of <CODE>test-+</CODE>. Interpreted code, on the other hand,
typically expands macros anew each time the code is interpreted,
allowing the effects of macro redefinitions to be seen immediately.</P><P><SUP>5</SUP>You have to
change the test to make it fail since you can't change the behavior
of <CODE><B>+</B></CODE>.</P><P><SUP>6</SUP>Though, again, if the test
functions have been compiled, you'll have to recompile them after
changing the macro.</P><P><SUP>7</SUP>As you'll see in Chapter 12, <CODE><B>APPEND</B></CODE>ing
to the end of a list isn't the most efficient way to build a list.
But for now this is sufficient--as long as the test hierarchies
aren't too deep, it should be fine. And if it becomes a problem, all
you'll have to do is change the definition of <CODE>deftest</CODE>.</P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
